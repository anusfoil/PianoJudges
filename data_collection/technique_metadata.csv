弹钢琴的速成教程，使用C调的敬拜诗歌《轻轻听》

基本的部分：（1) 用左手弹低音，（2）用右手弹和弦，（3）用嗓子唱旋律。如何找到任意的大调和弦？如果是C调，先弹C，然后加四个半音（就是E），最后再加三个半音（就是G）。如何找到任意的小调和弦？如果是A小调（Am）先弹A，然后加三个半音（就是C），最后再加四个半音（就是E）。学会C调的基本和弦：C, F, G, Am 和 Em。通过学习各种节奏，发展手指力量和协调性。练习，练习，练习，直到你流畅地掌握和弦与节奏，就可以很自然的、轻松的用任何和弦来弹各种节奏。只需看一下歌谱上的和弦，就可以马上弹出来。混合搭配节奏：用你对歌词表达情感的理解，选择最适合的节奏弹出来。掌握了C调以后，开始学习有黑键的调，譬如说 G调, D调, A调 和 E调（使用这样的顺序）。坚持下去，相信你的弹琴之路一定会走的很好，甚至可以在教会里弹几乎任何现代的赞美和敬拜诗歌。愿上帝大大的祝福你！

Crash course on playing piano using the Chinese worship song《轻轻听》in the Key of C. 

The basic parts are: (1) bass note in the left hand, (2) chord in right hand,  and (3) melody in the voice. Find any major chord (e.g. C) by playing the chord name note (e.g. C); add 4 half steps (e.g. E); and then add 3 more half steps (e.g., G). Find any minor chord (e.g. Am) by playing the chord name note (e.g. A); add 3 half steps (e.g. C); and then add 4 more half steps (e.g., E). Learn the basic chords for the key of C which are C, F, G, Am and Em. Gain finger strength and coordination while learning the various rhythms. Practice, practice, practice until you become fluent in the chords and rhythms so that you can play any chord using any rhythm automatically, without thinking too hard, just by glancing at the chord name in the song chart. Mix and match rhythms: choose which rhythm best suits the emotional meaning of what you want the lyrics to convey. Once you've mastered the Key of C, move onto keys with more black keys such as G, D, A and E (in that order). You'll be well on your way to playing piano for almost any modern praise and worship song in church. God bless you!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sdmulntks4,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmubt_IUS3usW59oU6PbrSg,"['指法错了', '自学的吧。。。指法错了', '2指和3指跨四度会不会很累？', '即係乜?']",0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The individual pieces progress from very easy and simple beginner études to very difficult advanced technical displays, and are used in modern piano lessons and education. In total, according to Bartók, the piece ""appears as a synthesis of all the musical and technical problems which were treated and in some cases only partially solved in the previous piano works."" 

Volumes I and II are dedicated to his son Péter, while volumes V and VI are intended as professionally performable concert pieces. Bartók also indicated that these pieces could also be played on other instruments; Huguette Dreyfus for example has recorded pieces from Volumes III through VI on the harpsichord. And there are transcription made as methods used for learning for other instruments, such as the harp and the guitar. 

In 1940, shortly before they emigrated to the United States, he arranged seven of the pieces for two pianos, to provide additional repertoire for himself and his wife Ditta Pásztory-Bartók to play in concert.

All of the six volumes progress in difficulty, namely:

Volumes I and II: Pieces 1–36 and 37–66, beginner level
Volumes III and IV: Pieces 67–96 and 97–121, moderate to advanced level
Volumes V and VI: 122–139 and 140–153, professional level

(Information with the help of Wikipedia)

These pieces are used in some conservatoires as fundamental learning material, and together with Bach, I believe they cover a vast range a pianistic techniques indispensable to the pianist. 

As compositional works, I believe these pieces to be made with excellent craftsmanship, and a great source of techniques and theoretical materials essential to the composer of the 21st Century.

A somewhat technical musical piece using the arm and wrist technique.

There isn’t many good score videos of humans playing on YT.', 'Another complicated czerny etude. The double intervals always sound beautiful - now that I think about it this piece sounds like many little bells ringing. A fun mood also :)', 'That’s a nice association, never thought about it this way, but it makes perfect sense!', ""@DenZhdanovPianist  Especially from 0:25 to 0:50 - interesting combination of harmonies. We have a, how's it called - chimes? - in my home town, that's why. You play really good. Best regards"", ""Amazing video as Always. \nI have two video suggestions if those were possible. \n1.

Of course, ornaments can (and often should) be performed in these works, but the music itself is essentially functional rather than ornamental, retaining the bare minimum necessary to support and sustain the structure; in other words, it gets to the heart of what is musically important and avoids bombast or special effects (although these have their place elsewhere, at least occasionally!)."", 'Can you Record Czerny Ocean Waves etude 20 from Op.692 or Hero number 21?', 'Yes I looked at those a while ago, I’ll return to them at some point, they are quite fun to play', 'I loved it, very orchestral sounding...', 'Then you probably recognized the solo of the Horn of Plenty!😜', ""Brilliant fingering! Hence the high speed, because the right hand can remain in position.

I studied op.299 as a teen, and I loved them. I certainly couldn’t play as fast as Mr. Czerny devilishly suggested, and definitely not as elegantly and perfectly as you do in your videos!', 'These etudes are composed for historical pianos which are probably 5x lighter then modern pianos.', '\xa0@DenZhdanovPianist\xa0 Oh my goodness! Thank you so much for the reply. I’d been absolutely flummoxed by the ridiculous tempo markings and thought Mr. Czerny must have had hands like Gyorgy Cziffra. I am so curious what it feels like to play on such lighter keys…', '❤❤❤❤', 'Amazing!! We need more pianists of your caliber on here rather than some wanna-be that trying to teach people technique, how to practice without even master the art themselves.', 'There are many more good pianists around than there is demand for them!😂', 'Very fine, indeed, Denis!', 'You are incredible! Just perfection in such a demanding piece! Chapeau. There is a lot of Czerny which deserve to be rediscovered in my opinion.', 'Such a high-level virtuosity. You make me want to practice some Czerny before going to bed. 😮 (though I only play op.849 which is rather easy)', 'Bravo!!!!', 'огонь!', 'Perfektion :0', 'Bravo Maestro.', 'Waooo!!!']",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Inland is the pianist’s continuation of the exploration of the minimalist composers register to complete the solo continuum of the Statea released in 2016 with the Mexican producer Murcof. Inland highlights a set of pieces, mostly rare or unavailable to date (Moondog, Nico Muhly, William Susman, Bryce Dessner, Gavin Bryars...) and some other well known (Philip Glass, Wim Mertens, Michael Nyman) that Vanessa Wagner performs with her classic pianist background and velvet sound.

My only comment would be that the transition between the right hand motif to the chordal bass in the last section is abrupt and leaves a gap in the flow - playing the motif a bit rubato in its final repetitions before those transitions would prepare the ground for what is to come, as well as creating a contrasting mood.

It would be one thing if he was sloppy, but had ingenious interpretations, (like Horowitz), or error-free, but uninteresting, (which applies to legions of pianists), but in every way his performances differ tom that of Neuburger's, they are wore. It's like comparing Libetta's Alkan to that of Hamelin's.\n\n\nReally, I dare you suggest a piece Libetta plays better than Neuburger, or even where there's any quality about it that makes it valuable. Neuburger might not have enough confidence in his abilities to play the pieces live, and Libetta has this confidence, but perhaps because he has lower standards."", ""\xa0@Manx123\xa0 Libetta has the best recording of Alkan's Sonata 20 Ans, Neuburger is a pianist with a common repertoire in concerts!  I don't even play 740 in concert and I don't understand why they are more beautiful and entertaining than those of Chopin"", ""\xa0@czeynerpianistproducercomp7155\xa0 I haven't heard any studio recording. I watched a video of the live performance, and it does not favorably compare with Hamelin's studio or live recordings.\n\n\nWhether Neuburger's repertoire is common is irrelevant. His recordings of 740 set is flawless, and superior in every respect to what exists of those by Libetta, who should really improve his technical skills, especially in this age where so much importance is placed on them. Again, it would be one thing if there was something compelling about his interpretations, but there isn't. With works like these, error-free execution is the minimum, and he doesn't meet it. \n\n\nAgain, nobody gives a shit that you think Czerny is a better composer than Chopin. You go on and on repeating it, and it's as obnoxious as it's contrarian tasteless."", ""\xa0@Manx123\xa0 It is so unpleasant that you think your opinion has some value because you are not a musician nor will you be! so your opinion does not interest me in the least because you do not upload a video playing a 740 etude and I will take care of judging you or are you a coward who only likes music? I think that if I don't like Hamelin's interpretations so much, however, I prefer Libetta's and again I repeat your opinion, I am not interested in the least because you are not a musician, you are just a fool and obsolete amateur"", ""\u200b\xa0@czeynerpianistproducercomp7155\xa0 You start out with a baseless and irrelevant personal attack, followed from an argument from authority. You would also be delusional to think most musicians agree with in rating Czerny's studies more highly than that of Chopin's.\n\n\nYou don't even attempt to defend Libetta's interpretations of the op. 740 studies, which, regardless of what you say, (in perhaps in contrast to what you know), are inferior to that of Neuburger's.\n\n\nAlso, nice job liking and ♥'ing your own comment, you self-serving idiot."", ""\xa0@Manx123\xa0 I will not defend them for an opinion that is worth absolutely nothing!  In other words, I know that the recordings of Libetta, Neuburger, Slater, and the other pianists who played Op.740 are perfect and beautiful.  I'm not interested in what most pianists in the world think about Czerny in the end they don't know anything about repertoire because they play the same works over and over again and don't know better music than they are playing for example Czerny Op.756, Op  .856, Op. 822, Op.691) 2 and all opuses of Czerny, Henselt, Marmontel, Mayer, Clementi, Cramer, etc.  I also repeat that your opinion and those of people who think like you are musicians or not, will never have value"", '\u200b\xa0@czeynerpianistproducercomp7155\xa0 I agree, your opinion is worth nothing and isn\'t worth defending. If meant my opinion wasn\'t worth attacking, (again, try to be more articulate), then you\'re writing an awful lot to avoid defending your opinion.\n\n\n""Slater""\nYeah, he\'s fine, I suppose, but technically and artistically, it\'s very little compared to Neuburger\'s. It\'s less favorable than comparing Ogden\'s Alkan recordings to that of Hamelin. \n\n\nI doubt even Neuburger would say Czerny\'s studies are superior to Chopin\'s. The most popular and perhaps overplayed pieces are made so because of their general excellence. The op. 740 is an exception among Czerny\'s works, but just about no pianist, not even those who play more obscure works, would agree with you on this, and surely, your opinion, considering your musical background, could probably be just as easily dismissed on that basis.', ""\xa0@Manx123\xa0 Neuburger is excellent but most times he plays slower than Libetta!  Libetta is literally a virtuous monster has played the 53 Chopin Godowsky etudes, 32 Sonates de Beethoven, Op.740 Completo, all the music of Handel and Chopin something that Hamelin has not done.  Hemelin just recorded etude 4 of 740 and then deleted the video I don't know why!  My opinion is more valuable than yours and that of many musicians and Chopin's etudes are obsolete after playing Op.756 of Czerny"", '\xa0@czeynerpianistproducercomp7155\xa0 Firstly, I wasn\'t talking about his other recordings, just that of the Op. 740. Secondly, ""faster"" or even more ""virtuosic"" doesn\'t mean worse, and that\'s an idiotic standard. Thirdly, feel free to give evidence of Libetta playing these pieces faster. This recording is roughly at roughly the same tempo at which Neuburger plays it, but far less consistent, and absolutely riddled with mistakes. Fourthly, recording more music doesn\'t necessarily make you a better musician, especially if it\'s this sloppy. Lastly, you\'ve given absolutely no reason your opinion doesn\'t mean shit, and speaking of the ""obsolesce"" of a work of music is incredibly moronic, not even considering that most concert pianists play Chopin\'s studies because they have inherent artistic worth and are popular with the public, while the vast, vast majority of Czerny\'s output isn\'t worth the paper it\'s printed on, or it\'s valuable only for its pedagogical uses.', ""\xa0@Manx123\xa0 I am sorry but the Chopin etudes are worthless, they are not even useful most are boring and plagiarized difficulties of other composers, they are simply worthless and are overrated. because you do not upload a video playing any preference you want and I will gladly rate your interpretation! otherwise you look like a dog that only barks and doesn't bite"", '\u200b\xa0@czeynerpianistproducercomp7155\xa0 Regarding the low opinion you have of the Chopin studies, you have simply come far too late in the world to have much influence, the studies of Chopin are far too well-known and loved, and their reputation will not be blasted by some nobody.\n\n\nNot sure what you mean by ""preference."" It\'s plainly obvious, however, you\'re just resorting to pathetic personal attacks because you can\'t actually back up your opinions with arguments, and expect what pitiful skill you\'ve obtained in playing, (I think I saw it once and was quite unimpressed), to somehow replace articulate expression.', ""\u200b\xa0@Manx123\xa0 I know many friends musicians who repudiate the Chopin etudes, because it is not pleasant for them and for me to listen to them all the time! and The only one who lacks opinions is you, and you always evade and deviate from the conversation when I tell you to upload a video playing with more musicality than LIbetta but well you know you can't! show the world that a piano fan can play better than a pianist with 45 years of experience"", '\u200b\xa0@czeynerpianistproducercomp7155\xa0 \u200b If I had to guess, you and people in your group probably couldn\'t even begin to play even the easiest Chopin study with any degree of adequacy, while Czerny offers studies will within your range of ability. Thankfully, most other people don\'t restrict themselves on the basis of what they would play, and pianists who actually have taste can actually play them.\n\r\nSecond part of your message is just the asinine argument, ""You can\'t criticize what you can\'t do."" My initial point was that Libetta was clearly inferior to Neuburger in his recordings, not that I could play it better than him. \n\n\nIf you want to play that game, none of your criticisms regarding Chopin mean a damn thing until you can write studies better than him. Go on. I\'m waiting. (I\'m curious whether you\'re delusional to think anything you have posted or will post could be better than Chopin\'s studies).', ""\xa0@Manx123\xa0 Everything you have written to me is worthless and you are still stubborn, if you do not have the talent to play the piano, do not think that everyone is equal to you, and Chopin's most difficult debt falls far below the 10th grade of the Op.399 of Czerny and even the bell that is the easiest etch of Liszt is more difficult than the 24 etudes of Chopin, works better than those of Chopin were already created by many composers including Czerny, Clementi, Cramer, Alkan, Mereaux , Kesller and Henselt! Chopin had no creativity and copied Henselt's Opus 2 from Op. 5 to make Opus 1 and 8 from Dec. 10 and also plagiarized Kesller of the next etude I will send you. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3kX71cAOg0"", ""\xa0@czeynerpianistproducercomp7155\xa0 Once again, nothing I said implied I can't play the piano. I could actually talk about my background in music, but it's irrelevant. You can keep repeating your opinions, but without actual argument, those are worthless. You actually attempted something resembling arguments, but when I refuted them, you resorted to assuming what my musical ability was, and then dismissing me on that basis. Again, I vaguely remember watching a video of you play, and you really, really overestimate your abilities if you think that gives you any authority.

You were, and even if that were valid, your pianistic abilities are so mediocre, it actually hurts your case. You would have been better off bullshitting about you've mastered the Chopin etudes, because based on that video, it's unlikely you have any significant ability."", '\xa0@Manx123\xa0 your opinion still has no value, because your channel has nothing', ""\xa0@czeynerpianistproducercomp7155\xa0 Again, really obvious you're resorting to this because your actual attempts at arguments didn't actually work. You then slowly shifted to just attacking me, and now you're just doing that because you have nothing left. It's ironic because I can actually defend my opinions with arguments, while you have to rely on videos of other people playing, and a video of your playing, which is fairly mediocre."", '\xa0@Manx123\xa0 It is not arguments and you will never have them, are you afraid to upload a video playing?  Is your technique mediocre?', '\xa0@czeynerpianistproducercomp7155\xa0 Since you clearly are incapable of producing any that are remotely cogent, this is why I am denied.

As piano maestro (myself, not so bad after all) and lover of piano music as well as of its greatest interpreters (of past above all :Horowitz, Benedetti Michelangeli, Gilels, Richter in primis), I can safely affirm that Libetta\'s technique is one of most outstanding and drop-jaw I saw in my life. So shut up and go to somewhere else to shoot crap, thanks!!', '\xa0@czeynerpianistproducercomp7155\xa0 he is clearly a very annoying troll, you lost enough of your time trying to respond to his no sense assertions. Thank you for all posts about Libetta.', '\xa0@AntonioPaterno\xa0 thank you I love the music of Czerny and how to play Libetta!  I hope Libetta decides to record Op. 756, 365, 399 or 692 of Czerny', '\xa0@czeynerpianistproducercomp7155\xa0 I hope for Op. 365 above all !!!', ""\xa0@AntonioPaterno\xa0 I'm basing on this video. The number of mistakes he made here are excessive. I'm aware of his reputation, but he's no Angerich, Hamelin, Cziffra, Rachmaninoff, Ginzburg, Tausig, etc. Not even close. He must have some familiarity with the piece, which is why he's playing it without the score, but why he thought he knew it well enough to record is beyond me. Perhaps he hasn't played it for a while and thought he knew it better than he clearly did."", ""I would say the only recording that compare with Neuburger's are the few \rDmitry Paperno made. He plays them with less subtlety, contrast, and emotion, but with much more clarity, with technically perfection, something utterly lacking in Libetta's recordings of these pieces."", '\u200b\xa0@AntonioPaterno\xa0 If I\'m ""trolling"" it\'s with opinions I genuinely feel. In regards to Libetta, he no doubt has great technical abilities. However, none of the pieces he records are done with much taste. If his pieces were at least technically flawless, that would at least make him comparable to Cziffra and Argerich, (though the latter has more taste and the former at least has a unmistakable boldness). However, I\'ve yet to hear a rendition from him where he clearly played it faster than was tasteful, or faster than he could actually manage. Comparing the performances of Neuburger or Paperno Czerny\'s Op. 740  to Libetta\'s, or Libetta\'s live recording to Alkan\'s 20 ans to Hamelin\'s live recording, both his excessive speed and more so his technical sloppiness in playing pieces faster than he can manage are very, very obvious. Plenty of great pianists made mistakes while playing, (like Horowitz, Anton Rubinstein, and Kempff, and even Liszt), but they always have passion, some strong passion or refined taste that makes up for it. This is totally lacking in Libetta\'s performances. I am open to being contradicted.', ""\xa0@AntonioPaterno\xa0 Forgive me as it can sound pretty much off topic amidst such context (and contest as well)....Just asking to you,as a committed piano player and teacher, how is it I can't find a single footage of Benedetti Michelangeli playing the op.10 n.1 etude by F.Chopin ? He allegedly did record it...my assumption. \nI could be wondering the same question about Horowitz whose Chopin performances are a worldwide patrimony,yet the op.10 n.1 is never in his vaste repertoire.

Thanks for listening!

About the work:
Charles-Louis Hanon (1819-1900) was a French piano pedagogue and composer. He is best known for his work The Virtuoso Pianist in 60 Exercises.

The Virtuoso Pianist (Le Pianiste virtuose) is a compilation of sixty exercises meant to train the pianist in speed, precision, agility, and strength of all of the fingers and flexibility in the wrists. First published in Boulogne, in 1873, The Virtuoso Pianist is still widely used by piano instructors and pupils. However, the applicability of these nineteenth-century exercises has been questioned by some piano instructors today.

Play through in all the keys chromatically, always holding the first note, alternating each new key ""piano"" and ""forte"", slow and fast. It\'s all written using the major scale, try substituting the whole tone scale, the two diminished scales, the chromatic scale. \n\nAs for the tremelo etude, if you insist on studying it, start by removing the tremelo figuration and play each chord as a block chord,  then slowly add in the tremelo figuration; put a tiny fernata on each new  chord, then tremelo (using rotation) your way to the next new chord/fermata, amd so on and so on. Cramer Etude no. 3 in the Von Bulow ed. (No. 12 in the original numbering system) is a great complimentary rotation exercise.

You also have to be very careful playing over forte as it is too easy to play loudly on the instrument and one can inadvertently break something, not just due to age, but also to the lighter construction than more modern pianos. So one needs to use a lighter touch at all times when playing one of these, and a variety of dynamics become available. They’re also great for rock music since the timbre is halfway between a guitar and piano, much like a hammered dulcimer.', 'REMEMBER (ribbon around finger emoticon), that in Hanon’s day, most extant pianos had a LIGHTER ACTION and LIGHTER HAMMERS than modern pianos. I don’t just mean “current-day” modern, but as old as c. 1885. Pianos from the beginning to mid 19th century often have an all wood frame (maybe with an iron bar for reinforcement), and the cast iron piano plate, introduced in the 1820s, was only more widely adopted decades later. So early pianos were lighter weight, lower tension strings, more fragile, more prone to go out of tune more often, and also had a lighter touch-weight action often with leather covered hammers that give a more “twangy” sound. So it was much easier to play virtuosically on these early pianos.', ""Now you've delivered some brand new information to me.

Denis Zhdanov has a course where he teaches economical movement with Hanon. I haven't bought it myself but the guy really knows his stuff. If you get the basics down with Hanon and learn the correct hand movements it will definitely bring your playing on quickly but it is a potential hand killer. It's also hard to play Hanon without tension at the recommended tempos and it's tempting to play through the tightness. I've been there."", ""\xa0@garethharrison5797\xa0 Thanks Gareth- I do have a teacher but I currently play mini versions of the Hanon exercises, usually just covering one octave with each hand so about half the length of the originals and I don't play them at the full tempo"", '\xa0@kandamy1\xa0 Cool. Enjoy!', 'Honest question: I grew up playing the saxophone in band. I learned how to read the ONE NOTE at a time on the treble clef. I’d like to start reading piano music, but at 34 I wonder if it’s even possible. How ON EARTH can the human brain process this much data at once? My eyes literally can’t even see all of the notes on the stave, let alone parse out their meaning. Is there someone out there that can give me any words of consolation, or am I just a lost cause?', ""I've played piano for a couple of years and just recently started to learn to read sheet music. I also had the same question as you and the conclusion I came up with is just to keep reading as your brain will see chords like how we see words, like when we see words we don't read each individual letter, we recognize the shapes and could tell which word it is when reading a paragraph."", ""You can. Reading piano sheet music is about recognising patterns. You identify to the 'top' note, then the distance between other notes in a chord is just a pattern / shape. With time you recognise these with ease and you can play block notes just as easily as single notes. Think of the word 'television', you don't read each letter individually, but the whole word in one go, because your brain knows that pattern of letters. It's the same with music - it's a language"", ""There's a big difference between playing something from sight, and learning a piece slowly until you have it pretty much memorised.  It comes with time, but yes, as someone who as a child learnt to play the violin, and who now struggles daily to practise the piano, I think about the violin pieces that I used to have to learn to play and wonder at how easy they would look to me now."", 'I agree with others\' analogy of words. It really is like that. Once you begin to recognize patterns, it becomes much easier. Even when playing one note with saxophone, you probably thought in terms of whether the music was getting higher or lower, or making a big jump somewhere. Those relationships between notes are easier to grasp intuitively on piano than they are on any other instrument - that\'s why I\'m college piano is used to explain music theory, no matter what someone\'s primary instrument is. \nHuman brains are capable of processing immense amounts of data- they do it in ordinary, everyday life - like with everything else, it\'s a matter of practice.\n\nEdit: also, the person playing this is definitely not reading it this quickly. They would have played it more slowly in the beginning and practiced to build up the muscle memory necessary to play it at this speed. Now they probably have it nearly memorized and what they have memorized may be something like ""I, V7, I, vi, V, V7/V, V, V7,"" which covers the entire first two lines of the sheet music. I say ""something like"" because chances are good that they\'re not at all thinking in words, but simply feeling/recalling the relationships between the chords. It is hard to explain, but as you begin learning an instrument, your brain begins cataloging patterns- that\'s what brains do best! So I\'m sure you\'ll be able to learn to read piano music. Maybe not as quickly as you\'d like, but also maybe more quickly than you would have guessed possible. You won\'t know until you try!', ""you'll be fine; at least the piano is in concert pitch!"", ""You can do it, but it's going to take a lot of effort. Knowing treble clef is half the battle of learning the staff so you're really ahead of the game compared to someone who has never read music before. One thing that helped me is learning a bass clef reading instrument (bassoon) on top of sax. But you definitely don't need to do this to learn how to read bass clef.\n\nOne other thing is that because the interval of transposition from Treble to Bass clef is the same as the written to sounding IOT for bari sax, you can read bass clef music on bari (or alto, It'll just be in the wrong octave) by just pretending it's in treble clef and adding 3 flats to the key signature"", 'The brain is never too old to learn, you are not a lost cause. What do children do to learn so quickly? They do not overthink, they accept and mimic, absorb and attempt. You are right, no human “reads” music. Everyone has given such great advice on how patterns are learned, etc. Let me add this to try and help you.\n\n1. Learn music theory, because again this is just patterns and how patterns relate to each other. It’s not difficult, but like reading the notes it seems mysterious at first. Just learn the basics, there is always more to learn, you just want to understand that all notes relate to each other and certain patterns are generally accepted as sounding pleasing to most ears. \n\n2. Utilize Hanon, because each exercise is a repetitive pattern and you can quickly see how to “skim” a whole page rather than painfully try to read each individual note. Say the notes out loud as you play and very quickly you will gain the skill of reading music and be able to apply it faster and faster each time you practice (yes slow and daunting at first, it’s okay to get frustrated and feel dumb). \n\n3. Learning this requires the time put in to build neurons. Your eyes get the information into your brain, you think about it, your hands are far away from your head and will not do what you want until you have built the neurons. Most of the time you will say “I know how, why can’t I play this at all!”.  Think about building a network of strings from your sheet music, through your eyes, through your brain, down your arms, into your fingers, onto the keys, and into the piano - this is a huge network! \n\n4. To get started, choose one note that you already know. Choose one finger. Highlight that note on a piece of sheet music, everywhere it occurs on that page. Use that one finger to play that note 8 times, then move your finger to the next octave up and play that note 8 times while imagining it printed much higher up.  C is obviously the easiest. Then go back to the first note and play it again 8 times while looking at the music. What’s the next note on your music? Is it higher or lower? Look at the piano and see if you can figure out the spacing for that next note and play it 8 times. This is all about building this spacial connection, you won’t do this for long it is just to start building the connection. Your hand will begin to know where to go when your eyes see the notes go up and down. Just use this to orient yourself, not drive yourself crazy or make it grueling. Because you’re not 4 years old you don’t have a piano teacher grabbing your wrist and placing your finger on the key, you must do it yourself, and just like a small child it will only take a few tries before you don’t need this. That note you highlighted? It should now be very recognizable on any sheet music and you will find learning the others much easier because you’re now learning them in a spacial sense rather than memorizing.', ""Just wait until you see what us Organists deal with.. Mendelssohn's Sonata in Cm goes into 5 staves at certain points. Best of luck figuring it out, you can do it!"", '\xa0@RedErin\xa0 I just want to thank you for this verb encouraging and thoughtful response. You’ve inspired me to persevere; I hope that highlight method is effective!', 'As a professional musician: once you learn enough THEORY, some pieces like this become very easy, to sight read and understand, if not to PLAY (while other more advanced pieces will remain difficult). This piece is built around the gimmick, or rather, figuration, of tremolos, and uses mostly traditional tonal harmony. Therefore, once you understand tonal harmony COMPLETELY or at least the basics (disregarding extended chords and jazz theory for this), one will then readily recognize the simple chords used in this, which are built up fully into block chords, but then broken up, with groupings of notes twiddled back and forth to make the double tremolos. Once you look at this VERTICALLY and see how the chords stack up, it all makes sense. Then the rest is just technique to play it.', 'Think about reading words. You don\'t go one letter at a time, do you? Your brain breaks the groups of letters into chunks called words (it does this with most types of information, the process is called ""chunking"", you can detect it everywhere if you pay attention. When you look at a house your brain sees that as a chunk, and not as a door, walls, windows, a roof, front steps, etc. You don\'t have to consciously mark every feature of the house, it\'s just a house. That\'s chunking at work making your life manageable.). When you first started reading, you had to take time to figure out what the letters even were, let alone how to chunk them into words, and there was no way you were going to read at a natural speaking pace like that.\n\nThat\'s the stage you\'re at with piano sheet, you\'re learning to read again, a good starting point, since you can already read the notes, equivalent to letters in my analogy, is to learn what the piano\'s ""words"" are so you can begin chunking them.', 'As a current saxophonist that studied all throughout college (I’m 41 now), it’s one of the things that we have to work at the most, and the learning never stops. 🥲 It can happen, but the work must be done.', 'Just gotta be born with it!', ""Très mal joué !

So the Neapolitan chord in C Major is a D-flat Major chord (Db-F-Ab.) In G Major, it would be an A-flat Major chord; in F major, a G-flat Major chord, etc. \n\nIt usually comes in first inversion – or, as some people call it, in ""sixth"" position, because any triad, when in first inversion, has the interval of a sixth between the bass and the treble.

It’s much harder to force people to actually practice the technique thoroughly if you just indicate a tremolo shorthand.  Plus, if it’s just empty note heads, an indicated tempo won’t actually make any sense because the speed of the tremolo is not indicated, only the length', '\xa0@pineapple7024\xa0 lol the speed is indicated, not if the tremolos are notated with a quaver you play each note as a semi quaver.', 'In string notation, alternating notes, notated with bars attached to a pair of hollowed notes always means a specific rhythm; 8th notes, 16th notes, 32nd notes, 64th notes. In piano notation, hollow notes with bars COULD mean an unmeasured tremolo, without a specified exact number of notes, similar to a trill — think of barrelhouse piano, or Ragtime, for example, or a piano-vocal reductions of opera.\nIn the same way, tremolos for string players on an individual note or a double stop, with flags through the stem, can be either metered or unmetered.\n The notation in the Hanon book leaves no room for doubt, so that might be the reason the tremolos are completely spelled out.', ""\xa0@Brad4Ellis\xa0 that's true, but most composers write the correct notation for one bar and then the short notaion (and write simile for example)"", 'Just need to notice that, if well played, this is a nice piece of music.

1. Allegro maestoso, common time
2. Andante cantabile con espressione, F major, 3/4
3. Presto, 2/4
A typical performance takes about 22 minutes.

The A minor sonata is the first of only two Mozart piano sonatas in a minor key (the other being No. 14 in C minor, K. 457). It was written in one of the most tragic times of his life: his mother had just died, and his father blamed him for his wife's death. Mozart was devastated, and poured his constant torment into his sonata, one of the darkest. The last movement in particular has an obsessive, haunted quality about it, heightened near the end by the interruption of the relentless drive to the conclusion by repeated and chilling quiet falling passages.

You probably won't hear such tinkling and biting mordents again in centuries. But what is at the base, behind and in which all this is accomplished, the love for music, that cannot be measured"", 'When you accidentally confuse your grand for a harpsichord', 'Props to the technician who regulated this piano. The dampers have to be set not only very precisely, but slightly later than spec for this to be possible.', ""Slightly later?  Could you please unbox, explain?  I only kinda know how (just started) to play the piano, but I'm very ignorant when it comes to being a piano technician"", 'I have absolutely no idea what you just said.', 'I would say it had nothing to do with the dampers, but more the repetition lever and the up and down weights.', 'So Sean is kinda right. I can\'t make a Kimball Spinet play as precisely as a Steinway, but there is so much that can be adjusted. \nAdjusting damper timing is one of the most finnicky things in regulation. In a grand piano, it is done by lengthening or shortening the damper wire by sliding it up or down in the damper wire block. It is held in place by a small set screw. When a key is played, the damper lever is contacted by the key end felt and begins to move. this movement is what lifts the damper from the string, and happens (usually) right when the hammer reaches the halfway point in the distance between its resting point and the strings (strike distance). \nSetting the damper ""early"" means the damper will lift sooner than that halfway point in the strike distance. Say you set it incredibly early. This does two things: The damper lifts almost immediately when the key is pressed, letting the string resonate freely. After the hammer strikes the string and the key is released, the damper only silences the string when the key is almost back at its resting position. This allows the string to resonate for a greater length before the pianist lets go, thus achieving a flowing, legato effect between notes. \n\nThe opposite is true as well. If the damper is very late, it will lift almost right when the hammer strikes the string, and snap back down when the key is released, silencing the note quickly. This adjustment complements a sharp, staccato playing style.\nHere\'s a lovely little diagram for reference:\nhttp://www.concertpitchpiano.com/GrandActionModel.html\nNeither of these examples are realistic, I haven\'t seen an instrument go outside 20% of spec when regulated to someone\'s preference. It\'s also important to keep in mind that this is just one of many factors that could help a quick sounding action. Touch weight is another incredibly important one that comes to mind, and one that I myself am very picky about. I would never buy a piano with heavy keys. (Unfortunately, most modern pianos feel pretty heavy to me.) \nSometimes, pianists are given a choice of instruments from the selection of the concert hall. I imagine for a piece like this, a piano with late dampers would have been chosen. Some pianists will request certain regulation specs before a concert. I\'ve heard of a technician that carries a set of 88 punchings to throw under the keys for one specific individual who likes very little aftertouch. It is possible that a request was made here for later damper timing, but it could also be a piano at spec, and the sharp articulation solely the talent of the pianist.\nI hope I didn\'t over-explain this. It\'s easy to talk at length about one of your passions.', '\xa0@antiquet3301\xa0 thank you so much for your insight!', '\xa0@antiquet3301\xa0 You were very informative and I learned a lot.

PAKtfkh0C1M_cut1,Repeatednotes,Great Pianists' Technique: Repeated Notes,20110829.0,924.0,97505.0,763.0,,77.0,"A collection of some memorable moments in repeated note-playing. This video can also be seen as a hymn of gratitude to Sebastien Erard for inventing the double escapement. And since Liszt greatly admired Erard's pianos it will not come as a surprise that most of the examples in this collection are Liszt's (we should perhaps blame Chopin for using the stiffer Pleyel's pianos :-) ).  It is a really sad fact of life that 15 min. is such a short unit of time and regrettably many other interesting excerpts (like Chopin Etude op.10/7) were left out. This is NOT meant to be a comprehensive catalogue of all repeated notes appearing in piano literature.


1) Moszkowski Caprice Espagnol Hofmann (1916);
(The eternal question of ""Who is the greatest pianist ever?"" will always remain elusive. But if we slightly change it into ""Who is the pianist with the greatest repeated notes ever?"" then the answer can only be ""Josef Hofmann"". In the Moszkowski's Caprice he dispatches the thorny long sequences of repeated notes at a whopping speed of 120 a dotted crotchet! Even a tremendous virtuoso like Eileen Joyce does not get close to Josef's stupendous rendition of repeated notes  (Eileen's sensuous recording can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXXL55rz0yE). I  bet that Josef could play faster repeated notes on an upright piano than most pianists could on a good grand piano. I tried to include as many of Josef's excerpts as possible but regrettably I had to leave out the live performance of the Caprice from his golden jubilee concert in 1937 and Schubert-Liszt's Erlkonig.)

2) Liszt Tarantella (from Venezia e Napoli) Hofmann (1916) 0:43;

3) Liszt La Campanella Hofmann (1923) 1:23;

4) Liszt Rhapsody No.2 Hofmann (1922) 1:54;
 
5) Liszt Rhapsody No.13 Busoni (1922) 2:20;

6) Mendelssohn Scherzo op.16 No.2 Risler (1917)  2:40;
(The repeated notes are not very challenging here but Risler's lightness of touch is miraculous.
""Eduard Risler has an inimitable soft touch. He has discovered those last delicate nuances which lie precisely between tone and silence. His tones seem not to begin and not to cease; they are woven out of ethereal gossamer."" from Oskar Bie, ""A history of the pianoforte and pianoforte players"" 1899.)

7) Scarlatti Sonata K.141 (L.422) Argerich Live 3:02;
(I think that the interpretation of this toccata would benefit from a slightly slower tempo; this said Argerich's repeated notes (116 a dotted crotchet) are truly phenomenal.)

8) Ravel Scarbo Argerich Live (1978) 3:37;

9) Schumann Carnaval Reconnassaince Michelangeli Live (1957)  4:01;

10) Ravel Ondine Michelangeli Live (1959) 4:18;
(Arturo's supreme control makes the impossible possible, realizing Debussy's utopia of making the piano sound ""like an instrument without hammers"".)

11) Debussy Etude No.9 (""Pour les notes repetees"") Bavouzet (2008) 5:08;

12) Liszt Transcendental Etude No.2 Berman Live (1976) 5:42;
complete performance: http://www.youtube.com/user/StockhausenIsMyCat#p/c/6777FFEDE6D32C85/1/3gGRwINrP8I

13) Wagner-Liszt Tannhauser Overture Bolet Live (1974) 5:56;

14) Scarlatti K.96 (L.465) Zecchi (1937) 7:05;

15) Scarlatti K.455 (L.209) Horowitz (1962) 7:26;

16) Liszt Rhapsody No.6 Horowitz (1947)  7:54;
(there are many other great performances of this famous passage so the choice was hard;  Argerich and Cziffra in particular are both wonderful and play this excerpt slightly faster and perhaps more excitingly; but in the end I opted for Volodja's who marvelously captures the capriciousness of this passage.)

17) Thalberg Grande Fantasie on Rossini's Semiramide Earl Wild Live (1981) 8:44;
 
18) Liszt Rhapsody No.9 Gilels (1951) 9:16;

19) Liszt Reminiscences des Huguenots Cohen (1996) 9:37;

20) Liszt Totentanz (version for solo piano) Cohen (1996)  10:29;

21) Alkan Concerto for piano solo, first mov. Hamelin (2006) 10:57;
(this is just a small excerpt from what are perhaps the most gargantuan repeated notes ever penned.)

22) Rzewski ""The people united will never be defeated"", Variation XXIV; Hamelin (1998) 11:32;
(Your new alarm clock...)

23) Liszt Rigoletto Paraphrase Bellucci (2001) 11:48;

24) Schubert-Liszt Erlkonig Richter Live (1949) 12:16;
(the terrifying repeated notes of Erlkonig are not Liszt's invention but already appear in Schubert's Lied; Schubert's predilection for this technique can also be seen in the finale of his Trio in E-flat D929. )

25) Liszt Mephisto Waltz No.1 Richter Live (1958)  13:06;

26) Scriabin Piano Sonata No.9 RIchter Live (1966) 13:40;

27) Ravel Alborada del Gracioso Richter Live (1965) 14:13;

28) Prokofiev Piano Sonata No.8 Richter (1961) 14:38",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAKtfkh0C1M,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOMf9cfYumvUhav6gzL4ERg,"['10:57 is the hardest piece in the video.', 'Evgeny Kissin played the repeated notes in La Campanella really fast at his performance in St Petersburg Conservatory', '11:48 is unfathomably beautiful', 'In carnaval, Schumann, cortot!', 'That recording of Ondine at 4:18.

On guitar, one reason would be the vibrating string is moving, but on the piano the key is coming up rather slowly even on some grand pianos. Actually on upright piano probably it's imppssible to do this speed of repetition of notes (tremolo if you will), because of the different technical settings between grand VS upright pianos.

Take Ravel\'s ""Jeux d\'eau"" and you will see what I mean.', ""Impressionist music is about colours. Notes blend together and create atmosphere. You have to abandon your idea of melody and singable tunes to appreciate it. It sounds like pseudo-intellectual bullshit but it's the truth."", 'Still easier to accept than contemp music', 'yeah well maybe you should just give up on music altogether, idiot', ""Aww, take it back! Debussy is one of my favorite composers :) Don't be a hater! But to be honest I agree with the other comments... it seems like you don't quite understand the music yet. Or maybe it's just not your thing, and that's ok too. But please don't ruin it for the rest of us who really enjoy this piece. Personally I find it very beautiful, complex, interesting, engaging. Consider the name, the picture it's painting. Haha, playing it is a whole different story... which is what brought me to this page, lol."", 'I love Bach and Debussy equally.', 'Awesome........ Debussy yeah!!\n', 'I like the joyful majestic sound at the end.', 'Does anyone know the year of recording?', 'Why u wanna know that?', '2009', 'Octavio12341000, to see the way that classical music transcends time.', 'Love it!', ""Not sure why...but I don't like this or Grenade Nearly as much as Pagodes...but I don't want to only play the first part."", ""+TakumaSD I also feel the same way with Suite Bergamasque. I don't like the last movement."", 'incieeee I like the last movement just not the second', '0:41', 'da fuck', 'lmao', 'Good video', 'It\'s funny how people are saying this piece is ""too fast"". As if they knew the composers intentions. I recommend that people listen to Yvonne Lebefure\'s interpretation.(Or even Marcell Meyers).\xa0It\'s fast as well. But the point is Madame Lefebure learned the piece directly from Debussy himself.\xa0 I think that Debussy wanted it played at this tempo because all of the people that learned direclty\xa0from him or learned from students in his student lineage all play it like this.', ""Piers Gleming Is that so?

La suite Iberia es una suite para piano solo compuesta entre 1906 y 1909 por Isaac Albéniz (1860 - 1909) y es sin duda la obra más importante del autor. Constituye una de las composiciones más célebres de la música del siglo XX y de todos los tiempos y representa el culmen en la dificultad pianística y su duración completa es de más de hora y media. De entre sus intérpretes cabe destacar a Alicia de Larrocha (cuya versión es la que se escucha en este vídeo), Esteban Sánchez, Rafael Orozco, Rosa Sabater y Luis Fernando Pérez. 

El cuaderno III de la Suite Iberia fue presentado en 1908, por Blanche Selva. Está dedicado a Mme. Marguerite Hasselmans. Las tres obras de este cuaderno son El Albaicín (por el barrio gitano de Granada), El Polo (palo del flamenco) y Lavapiés (barrio de Madrid). 

El Albaicín es una pieza misteriosa con un juego rítmico que cambia constantemente: se trata de un cante jondo, algunas veces apasionado y otras melancólico. La primera sección presenta un motivo vivo que es repetidamente interrumpido por los rasgueos de la guitarra flamenca a la que el piano imita.
