i9T3wRot2Es,,"Andrew Plays Ravel Gaspard de la nuit, M 55, III  Scarbo",20230115,560,508,18,,6,"""Gaspard de la Nuit"" is a piano piece written by Maurice Ravel in 1908. It is considered one of the most difficult pieces in the piano repertoire and is known for its virtuosic and complex technical demands. The piece is divided into three movements, each based on a poem by Aloysius Bertrand. ""Scarbo"" is the third and final movement of the piece, and is known for its dark and sinister character. The movement features fast, complex runs, and a sense of unease and disorientation throughout. This movement is infamous for its tremendous difficulty (both technically and musically!!), because Maurice Ravel intended this movement to be more difficult than ""Islamey"" by Mily Balakirev, which was already one of the most difficult piano works. ""Scarbo"" is a small fiend or goblin that appears in A. Bertrand's poem, who likes nighttime mischief. It makes pirouettes, flits in and out of the darkness, disappears and suddenly reappears. To convey its uneven actions, pianists need to properly understand the poem and the music, and then perform these formidable passages (e.g. repeated notes, major seconds, multiple tuplets) without hesitation. Despite its high level of difficulty, its profound musicality.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9T3wRot2Es,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzBQiuz2hkRsjiusC5CLYpQ,"['Stupid terrible performance', 'Really like your playing!

About Andrew Gu
“Classical music has the ability to inspire and uplift the human spirit. It has the power to move us emotionally and transport us to another place and time. In a world that is often filled with negativity and uncertainty, classical music can provide a sense of hope and beauty that can be hard to find elsewhere.”

Andrew Gu won his first international competition in 2015—the Grotrian-Steinweg; he followed that with wins at the Rosalyn Tureck (New York), Chopin (Hartford), Ettlingen (Germany), and Salzburg Festival (Austria), among others. He currently attends Miramonte High School in Orinda, California, and studies piano on the other U.S. coast with with Alexander Korsantia and Hitomi Koyama of the New England Conservatory Preparatory School. He made his concerto debut in 2020 with The Concord Orchestra and appeared on NPR’s From the Top that same year. Of his approach to music, he says: “One of the main things that drive my artistry is a desire to connect with others through music. I believe that music has the power to transcend language and cultural barriers, and I hope to use my performances to create a sense of unity and understanding.” Andrew lists his interests outside of piano as bicycling, coding, cooking, and value investing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ewn5LSUBv3Y,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzBQiuz2hkRsjiusC5CLYpQ,"['too good^^', 'Such great control and color ❤', ""It is no surprise such a stupid player didn't enter the second round"", 'Amazing!!', '앤디 대단하고 최고예요~^^\n멀리 있지만  많이응원해  화이팅~^~^*', '앤디 부모 한국인인가요?']"

But the church does not allow Liszt to marry Carolyne, because she could not terminate her first marriage. 

Carolyne cannot terminate her marriage while her husband is alive. Her relatives are against Liszt. She and Liszt remain unmarried, and Liszt suffers from emotional pain until the end of his life.Being loved by the public, Liszt is never really happy in his personal life, so he expresses himself making beautiful music.

Join us at 4p CDT, and watch all past videos at cliburn.org/amateurspotlight!

Irene Longacre-Whiteside believes that with age, for her, has come a “fresh awareness of the beauty and meaning in the complexities of the music I play and hear.” Over the last 20 years, she has developed a career as a high-level administrator, currently working at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport as executive assistant to the executive vice president of administration and diversity. In her formative years, Irene studied piano formally at the Royal Conservatory of Toronto, the University of Calgary, and the Universität Mozarteum in Salzburg, Austria. She then worked at The Conservatory at Mount Royal University, in her hometown of Calgary, before making the career transition away from music. And other passions abound: she enjoys the study of systematic theology, participating in international pistol shooting competitions, and scuba diving.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgQ2hSl9ccw,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['Bravo!

Ipek Bozkurt grew up on Van Cliburn stories. Her piano teachers, Elif and Bedii Aran, with whom she studied in Ankara for 15 years (and continues to this day), were themselves Juilliard students under Mme. Rosina Lhévinne, just as Van was. She moved to the United States to pursue a master’s and then Ph.D. in engineering management and has built a career as a professor, currently at the University of Houston Clear Lake. She was a self-described “newbie” to the world of amateur competitions in 2016 when she participated in the last Cliburn Amateur; she had an amazing experience, and the 2020 edition marks only her second competition appearance. She recently realized a 30-year dream of owning a grand piano—which she’s named “Black Beauty”—is fluent in two languages, working on two more, and says her “love of music can be extrapolated to all forms of art,” including film, literature, visual art, and knitting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpvL1eSC--k,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['Wonderful :))', 'tebrikler İpek .', 'Very good performance of Schubert, thanks!', 'Many thanks!']"

ABOUT KEN
Ken Iisaka has made the finals of the last three Cliburn Amateur Competitions. Since then, he’s taken the top prize in contests in St. Petersburg, Russia, and Washington, D.C. His activity in the amateur piano community has led to concert appearances in Germany, China, Japan, Canada, and across the United States. The Tokyo-born Canadian citizen has worked in software engineering since 1993, in California since 1999. He currently serves as lead software engineer for Indeed, a job search engine, in the artificial intelligence field. He also enjoys music criticism, writing regularly for the San Francisco Classical Voice.

Gabriela Maria Sęk-Mastej (Poland) - 1st prize winner , group III

F. Chopin - Waltz in E-flat major, Op. 18

The idea of Szafarnia Piano Competition was born in 1992, when the first nationwide competition was held. The subsequent editions already have had an international profile. Since that time, each year the competition becomes the first step to a musical career for many young pianists.

From year to year, volunteers and participants coming from almost every corner of the world gather in Szafarnia.
Musical efforts are assessed by the Jury including distinguished pianists and music professors from international music academies. The participants are young pianists between the age of 6 and 16. Their program is presented in three age categories (first – up to 10 years of age, the second – up to 13, the third – up to 16). The competition is open to all pianists who are not the students of state-owned music schools.

The idea behind the International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition for Children and Youth is a common experience of music for the young pianists from around the world, an exchange of experience and a chance for a better understanding over cultural differences possible with the universal language of music.

Natalia Masłowska - Poland

J. S. Bach – Invention No. 3 in D major, BWV 774 00:00
F. Chopin – Mazurka in B-flat major, Op. 7 No. 1 01:43
F. Chopin – Waltz in B minor, Op. 69 No. 2 04:20
T. Paciorkiewicz – Etude in D minor 08:50

The idea of Szafarnia Piano Competition was born in 1992, when the first nationwide competition was held. The subsequent editions already have had an international profile. Since that time, each year the competition becomes the first step to a musical career for many young pianists.

From year to year, volunteers and participants coming from almost every corner of the world gather in Szafarnia.
Musical efforts are assessed by the Jury including distinguished pianists and music professors from international music academies. The participants are young pianists between the age of 6 and 16. Their program is presented in three age categories (first – up to 10 years of age, the second – up to 13, the third – up to 16). The competition is open to all pianists who are not the students of state-owned music schools.

The idea behind the International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition for Children and Youth is a common experience of music for the young pianists from around the world, an exchange of experience and a chance for a better understanding over cultural differences possible with the universal language of music.

2022 Cliburn Gold Medalist
South Korea  I  Age 18

HOUGH Fanfare Toccata

In June 2022, Yunchan Lim became the youngest person ever to win gold at the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition; his performances throughout showcased a “magical ability” and a “natural, instinctive quality” (La Scena) that astounded listeners around the world. The depth of his artistry and connection to listeners also secured him the Audience Award and Best Performance of a New Work (for Sir Stephen Hough’s Fanfare Toccata). 
 
Just 18 years old, Yunchan’s ascent to international stardom has been meteoric. His final Cliburn Competition appearance with Rachmaninov’s Piano Concerto No. 3 delivered the defining moment of the three-week event; as one critic noted: “The applause that followed was endless: a star had emerged before our eyes” (Seen and Heard International). The video of that performance trended globally on YouTube in the days after, reaching #25, and has now become the most-watched version of that piece on the platform, amassing more than 5.5 million views in just one month. 

Yunchan has performed across his native South Korea—including with the Korean Orchestra Festival, Korea Symphony, Suwon Philharmonic, and Busan Philharmonic Orchestras, among others—as well as in Madrid, at the invitation of the Korea Cultural Center in Spain. His 2022–2023 inaugural tour as Cliburn winner takes him across four continents, with highlights including the Aspen Music Festival, La Jolla Music Society, and Performing Arts Houston in the United States; Seoul Arts Center, National Concert Hall in Taipei, and the KBS and Korean National Symphony Orchestras in Asia; and recital tours in Europe and South America.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2naEtxoVMo,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,

I think his music is fairly original."", 'Check your history again!! \n\nLiszt, the most bombastic acrobatic-clown on the piano among all, was only trembling and shivering if he had to play with Alkan around!! Chopin was a good friend and neighbor of Alkan! But this J Alkan was such an antic like any other Js ... so, he once didnt open up the door when Chopin knocked. The Pole then got pissed! And the J was so sorry. But, anyway, they have a deep mutual respect for each other.\n\nAnd it seems both loved to spit at Liszt the pompous clown.', 'I think he should have gotten higher placement (and at least third  place, I think). Unfortunately, if he played, for example a very technically difficult piece that was better known, like the Liszt Reminscences de Don Juan at the same level as this, he may have even won the entire Van Cliburn amateur competition.', ""Excellent point! Would be good for all to grasp. In our society there is only so much room for fame/notoriety. Because of the complexity of the capatalistic society we live in, and its inherent limitations, the masses may never actually encounter the greatest within any field...not just music. Just think how skewed our thinking of basketball would be if a certain entrepeneur didn't have the funds to round up some street players from chicago, call them 'Harlem Globe Trotters' and get them playin?"", ""Here's a little-known fact:  there are many great pianists around who are just as good as the 'famous' and 'successful' pianists. There's only room for a very few at the top of the profession.  And some don't want a performance career, which is very demanding and a grueling life.  \n\nThose of us lucky enough to hear Ken perform realize he is one of the greats.  He will perform publicly at the Concerts Grand series in Santa Rosa, CA in January 2009."", ""Hamelin's performance was uninspired and dull."", ""Why is it that the name 'Hamelin' comes to mind in response to your comment ;)"", ""I don't know what this guy does for a living, but good job!"", 'Amazing performance of this huge and difficult work, technically almost perfect and very musical too. \nThis is one of my favorite piano pieces, although I cannot play it even nearly as well as Mr. Iisaka. \nCongratulations!', 'i love alkan. i refuse to accept the thought that he s just a pianist s composer.\r\ngreat performance, congratulations!', 'Wow !  Bravo !', ""This is not an etude, but a piano concerto for solo piano. I don't know, maybe it is also called an etude."", 'look up mark andre hamelin playing alkan, and you will enter a new world. :)', 'Honestly, I think that the jury did not appreciate/understand the piece that much. It is rare to hear this any competition, especially an amateur one.', 'Well, if I was the jury. I would have tied Drew Mays and Ken Iisaka for first prize. It is just hard to compare Alkan with other music. But nice job!! Then Slava Levin would get third. If I was the jury, that is.', 'Hi there can you please tell me the name of thise piano competition.? Thanks a lot', ""Wow. I prefer this to most commercial recordings I have heard. Very uncluttered playing, but played with feeling. I think this clip captures what Alkan really intended- something that's not always too obvious. I must go to the Cliburn site and hear the full performance.\n\nDo you play the second and third movements too?"", ""I'm very impressed by how musical the playing is here. Too many people give Alkan a bad name with lifeless note-spinning. This is very good indeed."", ""Yes, wonderful to hear Alkan. I have an ancient vinyl recording that I'll have dig out and listen to his work some more."", 'Kiisaka, what is the name of this Alkan piece?', ""There are several aspects of this piece that I enjoy a lot, from this recording, though I wasn't at all sure I might.  Hope they do post the rest!\n  The overresonance on all the audio tapes from the hall may indicate that is what the audience may have experienced too (a need for more relief from extended overlapping sound in fast passages) but even your mostly unpedaled Soler had the wraparound sound in that kind of audio atmosphere)."", 'Overall, more jazzy and romantic than I expected.  I suspect the jury was in traditional mode, judging more highly only what they knew well (as a composition) and had a handle on.  Or liked.\n That we could hear this in an amateur competition instead of just the usual repertoire should have been seen as a plus and, in my own view, given some kind of recognition for it.  I liked being able to hear this.', ""I liked especially the more rhapsodic portions starting at 03:33 and 05:45 into the track.  Didn't expect this from the blog comments. The last part of this track, however, has Alkan going on at full sound and I would like to hear how that was handled.  I suspect they will post a part 2 later.  I hope so."", ""Darn, cut off in an especially exciting section. Anyway, good job on some ridiculously difficult music!  After reading the uncomprehending blogger on the Cliburn site, I wondered if there was a problem with the playing that might have affected his perception of the music.  Now that I've seen this clip, I figure it was the blogger who just didn't get it.  (The Cliburn really should stop that competition blogging nonsense and just run an open forum, a lightly moderated one, instead.)"", ""I guess the rest got cut off due to size/time constraints...I'd love to see parts 2 and 3 of this performance if they ever get posted.""]"

Herman Med Cerisha (Romania) - 1st prize winner - I group
F. Chopin - Impromptu in A-flat Major, Op. 29

The idea of Szafarnia Piano Competition was born in 1992, when the first nationwide competition was held. The subsequent editions already have had an international profile. Since that time, each year the competition becomes the first step to a musical career for many young pianists.

From year to year, volunteers and participants coming from almost every corner of the world gather in Szafarnia.
Musical efforts are assessed by the Jury including distinguished pianists and music professors from international music academies. The participants are young pianists between the age of 6 and 16. Their program is presented in three age categories (first – up to 10 years of age, the second – up to 13, the third – up to 16). The competition is open to all pianists who are not the students of state-owned music schools.

The idea behind the International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition for Children and Youth is a common experience of music for the young pianists from around the world, an exchange of experience and a chance for a better understanding over cultural differences possible with the universal language of music.

Reminder: All Cliburn Amateur Spotlight videos to date are posted at cliburn.org/amateurspotlight!

ABOUT ADRIENNE
After Adrienne Johnson earned a Bachelor of Music from University of Minnesota in 1977, she was accepted into The Juilliard School, where she completed her master’s. She went on to forge a career as an elementary teacher and playwright, authoring two plays each year at her school, the Archdiocese of St. Paul. One of her plays, The Annunciation of Mary, was nominated for a Grammy® music educator award. (She’s currently working on a musical about the immense contribution of Fred Rogers.) In the meantime, she also raised four boys; she returned to the piano seriously around 10 years ago, after the youngest left home. Adrienne is also a huge advocate of community service: she works with local organizations to bring music to retirement and health communities, and she is dabbling in music therapy for autistic children. A past participant in a number of international competitions, including the 2016 Cliburn, she hopes her next Cliburn experience raises her to a higher level of audience communication.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Etx6W9NsnpE,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['Great interpretation of Ondine. Big hands! She makes it look so easy (and it definitely is NOT easy).', 'Impressionante... chapeau Adrienne!', 'Bravissima!', 'Очень красиво ! Браво !', 'Great job Adrienne!', 'Wow.', 'Gorgeous!', 'hi']"

YUNCHAN LIM, 2022 Cliburn Gold Medalist
South Korea  I  Age 18

LISZT 12 Transcendental Etudes

Yunchan Lim launched onto the international music stage when he was 14. He won second prize and the Chopin Special Award in his first-ever competition, the Cleveland International Piano Competition for Young Artists in 2018. That same year, he stood out as the youngest participant in the Cooper International Competition, where he won the third prize and the audience prize, which provided the opportunity for him to perform with the Cleveland Orchestra. 2019 meant more accolades, when, at the age of 15, he was the youngest to win Korea’s IsangYun International Competition, where he also took home two special prizes.
 
Now just 18, he has performed across South Korea—including with the Korean Orchestra Festival, Korea Symphony, Suwon Philharmonic, and Busan Philharmonic Orchestras, among others—as well as in Madrid, at the invitation of the Korea Cultural Center in Spain. He also participated in the recording of “2020 Young Musicians of Korea,” organized by the Korean Broadcasting System and released that November. 
 
A native of Siheung, Yunchan currently studies at the Korea National University of Arts under Minsoo Sohn. Coming to Fort Worth, he says he is “looking forward to playing in front of the warmest and most passionate audience in the world.”",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcpjQUmYpBw,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['Finally finished learning the piece after watching him perform for the first time. You’re an inspiration Yunchan! (Still have a ways to go before I can play like him though 🥲)', 'Does anyone know which hands I should use for which notes in bars 71 to 78?', 'You can do either. I recently sight read through this and found crossing over is more comfortable (LH takes the top part). But I have seen others do the opposite. The edition I have does not specify, so I don’t think Liszt specifically indicated either one', '\xa0@JramLisztfan\xa0 thank you!', '임윤찬♡forever', '감사합니다 thank you', 'wow i can sight read this piece almost perfectly', 'Same also I can sight read mazeppa perfectly', ""Very nice.  It's great to see a young pianist play with individuality. So many new generation pianist are superb technically but sound a lot alike."", '감사합니다💕', '갈수록더보이고들리고느껴지고.........', '3:37-4:05 is unbelievably beautiful and at the same time full of pain and gloom. I like his interpretation of this part the best.', '아름답다  그저 갓갓 ㅠ', 'Beautiful', '3:24\n4:05', '평화롭다♡', '이거 너무 좋잖아 나도 모르게 노래를 부르고 있다', '“풍경” 서정적인 곡이 눈물 나게 아름다워요. 누군가가 그리워지는 날의 아련한 풍경을 눈앞에 펼쳐주는 마법 같은 연주입니다. 돌아가고 싶은 어느 날, 행복했던 한때가 떠올라서 가슴이 먹먹합니다.', '이렇게 고요한 곡도 마음에 한음한음이 세겨지네요.. 한음한음에 마음을 담았기 때문이겠죠', 'Tremendously beautiful and pure performance! I just thank this young boy cause now i finally find out the happiness and peace in my life.', 'Shivering aching beauty', 'https://youtu.be/HU2ts-s92ZU', '임윤찬 피아니스트 좋은 음악 선물주셔서 고마워요^^', '너무 좋아하던 곡이었는데~ 윤찬의 버젼이 가장 좋아요. 유럽 어느 시골마을 오두막에서 밤 새 비 내리고 난 후의 맑게 갠 아침, 촉촉하고 시원한 풍경 안에 있는 것 같은 느낌이에요!  윤찬군 나이는 어리지만 진심으로 존경합니다', '3.풍경: 고요하고 아름다운 정경을 묘사하는 작품. 느리고 조용한 분위기를 나타낸다. 리스트 초절기교 연습곡 중 그나마 가장 난이도가 낮은 곡이다. 나무위키', 'I feel so sorry for Liszt.. I finally came to feel the beautifully layered music thanks to this dear boy', 'and some people still nowadays say liszt is all about technicue only... when he even made etudes that musical when etude is supossed to be just warmup trainings for fingers 😂😂❤❤❤ liszt is great bro i congradulate u that u like liszt XD', '내가 리스트에게 이렇게 집중하게 될 줄 몰랐네요. 아름다운 연주 감사해요.🌸', 'so beautiful 😍', 'He said his purpose of playing the piano is to express the pain deep inside us and to heal people, again with music. \n "" \'Real\' things are not seen by eyes. Music also is not visible, and I think it is one of the very few real ones in this world.. It\'s the reason I will keep pursuing music for the rest of my life.""\n\n""Music  is transparent, it can\'t deceive people. So I always try to have a genuinely compassionate and understanding heart toward human beings and the world.""', 'What a pure and beautiful soul', '너무 근사한 윤찬군~!', 'If so, he is on the right track. He heals me. He rejuvenates me. He is my messiah.', 'Amazing한 연주에 \n감동의 눈물이 납니다']"

pN_KECMQuCc,,Cliburn Amateur Spotlight: Eladio Santiago,20200527,462,1173,27,,2,"To kick off today's Cliburn Amateur Spotlight Marathon from West Friendship, Maryland: Eladio Santiago, a 58-year-old president & CEO in advisory investment management, performs Chopin's ""Heroic"" Polonaise!

Lots of great music coming today, with more Amateur Spotlights at 11a, 3p, & 4p CDT, and a Cliburn Watch Party at 1p with 2017 Finalist Yury Favorin (who will be with us in the chat from his home in Russia)!

ABOUT ELADIO
Eladio Santiago’s lifetime love of music is directly intertwined with his admiration for Van Cliburn. His first RCA album in the 1970s was Van’s groundbreaking recording Chopin’s Greatest Hits and the Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No. 2; he fell in love, very young, with the sweeping Romantic interpretations, and much of the repertoire he developed through the years was under that influence. He had the opportunity to meet Van Cliburn twice: first, backstage in the 90s, while studying with 1981 Cliburn Silver Medalist Santiago Rodriguez at the University of Maryland (where he earned a B.M. and M.M. in music); and again in 2004 at the Kennedy Center, after a career in Wall Street had taken him away from music—that encounter helped bring him to the piano with encouragement from his wife, a pianist and teacher. In 2018, he founded Strategic Investments Corp, an investment portfolio management and advisory firm where he serves as president & CEO.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN_KECMQuCc,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['Excelente!', 'Ф.Шопена прекрасно исполнял А.Султанов.Музыка Ф.Шопена вечна.🌹🍀🌷']"

ABOUT ANNA
Having earned a Ph.D. in Political Science (International Journalism) from Saint Petersburg State University, Anna Antimiichuk equipped herself well for a successful career in international communications. In addition to professorship stints, she’s held various high-level corporate positions, primarily in the digital/IT space. She moved from her native Saint Petersburg to London last year to go on with her current tenure as Global Head of Communications for ClauseMatch, a RegTech company transforming compliance at financial institutions and other regulated industries. But she’s loved classical music and piano since childhood - thanks to her mom Mikaella who took her to the philharmonic and the Mariinsky Opera and Ballet performances almost daily. She prepared, from an early age, to be a musician, graduating from the Music School 11 in Saint Petersburg in 1998 (the class of Arkady Borzenkov), followed by two years at the city’s Mussorgsky College of Music (the class of Tatiana Osipova). Now an active amateur pianist, she continues to immerse herself in art as a patron, by attending the philharmonic and opera, as well as watching sports competitions: soccer, Latina dance, and figure skating.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVOgcRqEZKg,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['Delightful playing, Ms.Antimiichuk.

YUNCHAN LIM, 2022 Cliburn Gold Medalist
South Korea  I  Age 18

LISZT 12 Transcendental Etudes

Yunchan Lim launched onto the international music stage when he was 14. He won second prize and the Chopin Special Award in his first-ever competition, the Cleveland International Piano Competition for Young Artists in 2018. That same year, he stood out as the youngest participant in the Cooper International Competition, where he won the third prize and the audience prize, which provided the opportunity for him to perform with the Cleveland Orchestra. 2019 meant more accolades, when, at the age of 15, he was the youngest to win Korea’s IsangYun International Competition, where he also took home two special prizes.
 
Now just 18, he has performed across South Korea—including with the Korean Orchestra Festival, Korea Symphony, Suwon Philharmonic, and Busan Philharmonic Orchestras, among others—as well as in Madrid, at the invitation of the Korea Cultural Center in Spain. He also participated in the recording of “2020 Young Musicians of Korea,” organized by the Korean Broadcasting System and released that November. 
 
A native of Siheung, Yunchan currently studies at the Korea National University of Arts under Minsoo Sohn. Coming to Fort Worth, he says he is “looking forward to playing in front of the warmest and most passionate audience in the world.”",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzuxIauqMHM,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['Enough dude, probably the ant is dead.', 'The whole pianist profession is now discovering a new standard of playing, and they all understand now - that there is a new category of musicality where only this young master belong in.\nLiszt is back.', ""3:18 His hands are all a blur.

What a young genius. We will hear more from him.', ""Lang lang's school of faces....kkkk"", ""I was in the audience for this entire competition.  His performance of liszt's spanish rhapsodie imho was one of the greatest musical moments.  I think he deserved 1st alone\nThis performance of Scarbo is THE ultimate performance - even Ivo P. can't touch him"", 'I can\'t forget this man for over 5 years. When I was a junior high school student, my music teacher showed me a TV program, about ""Van Cliburn International piano competition in 2009."" In this competition, the winner was Nobuyuki Tsujii. But, I thought, Zhang\'s piano was more beautiful, stronger and better than Tsujii\'s one. Of course, Tsujii is a very good pianist. But I like Zhang, Not Tsujii. I don\'t know many things about piano, but Zhang\'s piano was really moved me.', 'why would the video editor not sync the audio', 'the best after YuJia Wang, Yundi Li prime, now the best in china', '有思想的演奏，情感复杂， 引人深思，这一点是比吴迪更妙的，也许这就是当年和辻井一起获奖的原因。但是我觉得对于辻井获奖也不需要太上纲上线，设身处地，可以看作辻井的音乐同样带给我们新的思考， 如果把自己放在一片黑暗中，你会看到黑暗中努力接近光明的人，能看到怎样的世界。', 'Awesome! Comparable to Pogorelich and Michelangeli.', 'Do not,I repeat,DO NOT mention pogorelich with MICHELANGELI in one sentence.SACRILEGE!!!!', 'spotted', 'The Piano Corner TPC why', 'His scarbo is the best ever heard no doubt', 'Can you guys tell me what he is playing? I know I sound dumb.. but I want to know', '# LETMETALK Ravel Scarbo', 'Please listen to LUCAS DEBARGUE performing Gaspard de la nuit and Marijnsky theather in St. Petersburg, the video is about 47 minutes.\nsensational, would love to hear the comments.

They lacked class and personality.', ""he doesn't play all the notes!!! 3:01- 3:04"", 'damon salvatore\xa0You listen to a performance like this of one of the most difficult works in the repertoire and this is all you can offer? Do you play the piece? I\'m guessing you haven\'t, because if you had taken on this challenge yourself, you would understand Zhang\'s achievement, which you clearly do not.\n\nI have played this piece for a good part of my life.  I played it half decently when I was young (too old now), but nothing like Zhang. This is simply stupendous playing. To those who have mentioned the Pogorelich, I agree -- also a great performance.\n\n\nThe trick with Scarbo, particularly, is to achieve the thrilling wildness that it needs without having a train wreck. Michelangeli was known for his playing of this work and I would be the last person to deny his pianistic mastery. But, unlike, say, Rubinstein, Horowitz or Richter, all of whom would take risks in performance to tremendous effect, Michelangeli was a perfectionist and I think he tended to err on the side of caution as a result. I heard him play Gaspard in recital many years ago and note-perfect it was, but I found it boring. The young Argerich throws caution to the winds, and while not note-perfect, her performance will bring you to your feet screaming even if you are at home alone listening to the recording. In a piece as difficult as this, you can\'t have it both ways, and I much prefer the Argerich approach. As Mme. Lhevinne once said about Rubinstein\'s wrong notes ""ah, but WHAT wrong notes!"".', '+Donald Allen The only pianist who can play Gaspard de la nuit\nis IVO POGORELICH!!\nCheck out his performance in Japan 1983, part one and part 2.\nExtraordinary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!', 'very fresh sounds!!', 'dat hand spam though (in the very beginning)', 'Haochennn', '技術表現ともに素晴らしい演奏です。なぜ辻井さんと同じ一位だったのか全く分からない、才能の次元が違うと思います。ぜひこの素晴らしい誠実な演奏のままこの才能を成熟させていってほしいです。', 'morinoroba様、古い話ですが辻井伸行はAVEX所属でした。今もそうですが。AVEXが審査員達を買収したらしいですよ。Haochen Zhangさんは辻井伸行より遥かに素晴らしいです。審査員が甲乙付けられぬ訳が無いでしょ？辻井伸行は未だに学生レベルだと思いませんか？', 'もしそれが本当ならば、ある意味一番の被害者は辻井さんなのかもしれないですね。', 'morinoroba様、辻井君はおそらく世間の事は余り判ってないでしょうから、佐渡裕がAVEX所属でその関係でAVEXへの所属を勧めたのではないでしょうか。だから下らないプロダクションの操り人形で矢張り下品なTV番組に出されたりしている始末です。辻井君が生まれつき全盲だという事を最大の理由にして聴衆の関心を買おうとしているのでしょう。私は佐渡裕を本物の音楽家とは微塵も思っていません。事情通の話ではコンクールの会場にはAVEXの宣伝の横断幕が貼り付けて有ったようです。この時の結果発表の模様もヤラセバンバン臭が漂ってましたね。', '逆に中国共産党がクライバーン財団に金積んだんじゃないの？辻井氏へのファイナルでの嫌がらせを見てそう思った。\n仮にavex が賄賂掴ませたとしたら、あのファイナルでの失態はあり得ないでしよ。\nまぁ真相は闇の中だけど、\n今やどう考えても勝ち組は辻井氏だね。', 'The whole Gaspard performance was phenomenal... like Lang Lang and Yuja Wang he studied with Graffman, but in my opinion he already surpasses both with his superb artistry.

Again imho - finest recorded performance ot that piece ever.  He has a way of making the same music sound different.  It strange and wonderful', 'What a technique, super feeling!!', 'I normally expect to be a little bored when someone plays Ravel but this pianist played Ravel with a transforming excitement that captivated me throughout the performance.\xa0 This is so fresh, like someone cleaned a diamond back to its original luster shine.', ""We wouldn't expect a homophobic asshole like Fred MyOpinion to grasp the music of Ravel, a homosexual.\xa0 Then again, heteroexual males do have smaller brains, and lower cognitive functions. Heterosexual males also have lower spatial memory and verbal skills. I noticed that the homophobe Fred has pretty low skills on all those markers.\xa0 Perhaps it's because he's a heterosexual male, and acts like an immature moron?"", 'Bravo -A new light shines-original, honest with a grand keyboard manner!\nWonderful to hear \xa0a fresh approach to this sacred Ravel-', ""That's very well played, with great care of Ravel's dynamic markings.

That just seems like complete and utter nonsense. Are you telling me all the great black pianists in history didn\'t have soul or emotion?

The reason for that os the lack of proper cultural and educational background. Even those srudying in Beijing and Shanghai Conservatories are in general less educated than their counerparts in Europe, Russia and the US. The EQ of Chinese people is still inferior to western people because in a country with 1,3 bln people per capita EQ  level is lower (the gene dissipation issue). ', '@CaroKahn actually it was never true, it was just socially accepted. It\'s just now that people are exposed more to different people they realize they are no different than themselves.

Bass Performance Hall

YUNCHAN LIM, 2022 Cliburn Gold Medalist
South Korea  I  Age 18

LISZT 12 Transcendental Etudes

Yunchan Lim launched onto the international music stage when he was 14. He won second prize and the Chopin Special Award in his first-ever competition, the Cleveland International Piano Competition for Young Artists in 2018. That same year, he stood out as the youngest participant in the Cooper International Competition, where he won the third prize and the audience prize, which provided the opportunity for him to perform with the Cleveland Orchestra. 2019 meant more accolades, when, at the age of 15, he was the youngest to win Korea’s IsangYun International Competition, where he also took home two special prizes.
 
Now just 18, he has performed across South Korea—including with the Korean Orchestra Festival, Korea Symphony, Suwon Philharmonic, and Busan Philharmonic Orchestras, among others—as well as in Madrid, at the invitation of the Korea Cultural Center in Spain. He also participated in the recording of “2020 Young Musicians of Korea,” organized by the Korean Broadcasting System and released that November. 
 
A native of Siheung, Yunchan currently studies at the Korea National University of Arts under Minsoo Sohn. Coming to Fort Worth, he says he is “looking forward to playing in front of the warmest and most passionate audience in the world.”",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cBJzSMCq-M,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['초희귀레어 피카츄사냥', 'This is a goat performance', 'Why is noone talking about how beautiful 2:14 is?', ""Yunchan playing the piano is like a cartoon. The music is perfect, but the emotion...it's unreal...too good to be true..."", 'Pure genius on another level.', 'I love how he smiles and looks joyful depending on where in the piece it is\nhis expressions are so good', 'he gave totally a new life to these etudes. He plays every etude like it were the last time in the life he could play it', ""형이 저의 '칸 영화제' 이십니다."", 'Wow, it’s amazing', 'Hats off!! Best and only WJ in this universe', '10th second. A mistanke :0 I couldnt play it better myself.', 'This is crazy!', '4:34', ""I feel like people don't talk enough about just how utterly phenomenal this particular performance is. Yes his Feux Follets was astounding but we already had Kissin's near-untouchable recording of Feux Follets to enjoy. For Wilde Jagd however, this recording is literally THE BEST recording, hands down. Ignoring the fact that every single note is clear, all the lyrical parts sing, the rhythm is impeccable, the articulation is on point, AND even besides the inhumane ending, the thing that stood out to me is that compared to all other performers, Yunchan Lim's Wilde Jagd is so thoughtfully structured, never an over-indulgent moment, never a note out of place, yet still stock-full of contrast. \n\nIf I had to pick one out of all 12 Transcendental Etudes to represent Yunchan Lim's genius, it must be Wilde Jagd. His performance was not just spectacular, it was revolutionary - it sounds like a different piece altogether compared to everyone else. And he did it live at 18!?!?!?"", 'I agree', 'He also did this after two really taxing etudes and knowing there are 2 more at the end.', 'Well said young man', 'listen to ivo pogorelich version of wilde jagd it will blown your mind', 'He should perform Alkan once. This entire live recording already proves he has the capabilities to do so.', ""TBF kissin's wald jagd was also untouchable"", '\xa0@Numberonesorabjifan\xa0 ehh, it’s rushed a bunch and pedaled, really melodic and slow at the second part of the song though but I think pogorelich’s version is more focused and expressive and only worries on what sounds good, not playing what the composer wrote.', '4 seconds less than Kissin’s performance at age 42', 'At 1:18 his face KILLS ME. THIS MAN IS SWIMMING IN PIANO MUSIC.', ""Yunchan one of the best already! Wish he doesn't turn into another Kultyshev"", '2:57 one of my favorite parts of the etude and he nailed it exactly as I interpreted it. Sublime.', 'Sweeping gloriousness.', '이런 모습 소중해요 . 간직해야해요 세월이 \n흐르면 다른 모습이 나오죠 ♡❤️', '4:34 瘋了，踏板正接不用:face-fuchsia-tongue-out:', '임윤찬♡forever', 'The sweat dripping at 2:20 to 2:30!!!', '진짜감동적이다.. 에튀드에서 이렇게 감동적일수있냐', '👍👍👍', ""My ears can finally enjoy hearing LIszt.  First performance of Liszt I've ever heard that is enjoyable to the ears."", 'there is much better', ""\xa0@treymulholland\xa0 I wonder if the reason why you don't list an actual example is because most performances of Liszt are unpleasant and its a struggle to find one worth mentioning"", '\u200b\xa0@cgullcharlie\xa0try benediction of God in solitude by arrau', 'The best ‚Wilde Jagd’ the world has ever seen. \nHe was completely in the zone all the way through, as if he became one with the music', 'He has the cutest face expressions 😅 his playing is so magical! He is amazing:0', '😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️', '1:19 hahaaa', 'You can hear the struggle, the excitement, the triumphs, and explosive power of not only the piece, but of the pianist as well, which is what makes this performance that much more special. This is proof that classical music is still exciting, entertaining, and just good fun! I hope in future performances Yunchan Lim throws his kerchief to his adoring fans in true Lisztian flair! 😉😂❤️', 'u described the feelings I had!', 'Oh my gosh yes! Lisztian flair alright!', 'Ngl this etude ramps up the difficulty of playing all the transcendental etudes in one sitting by a huge margin \n\nThe difficulty of this is seriously underrated especially since you would have had to play fuses mazzepa feux follets vision AND eroica prior to this', 'It’s a huge strain on your arms and hands and uses up a lot of energy lol, thank god the Etude right after this is relatively calm.', '4:08 이 노래가 너무 사랑스러워 미치겠다는 표정…..난 윤찬 피아니스트 연주에 미치겠어요….', 'Marvellous.   What’s more is that he does no face-pulling, no mad grimaces, no nose touching keyboard, no fancy arm gestures - he simply makes music as though he was born to do just this.   I think he has had a very, very good teacher.', 'His teacher is minso sohn he has a complete  recording  of Beethoven sonatas', '\xa0@alanleoneldavid1787\xa0 :  Sorry, but do you mean Minso Sohn has made a complete Beethoven sonatas recording, or that Yunchan Lim has?', 'He does do that. Just listen to the music man.', 'But even with a teacher like Minsoo Sohn, Yunchan is himself, he plays like Yunchan, and nobody plays like him (said Minsoo Sohn !€', 'Just another average Lang Lang hater 💀', '04:34', '피날레가 거의 가-랏 피카츄 ! 100 만 볼트 같네', 'One word: PERFECT!!!', '👏👏👏', 'Just hearing him has transformed my own playing and practicing. He makes me aspire to purity.', '언제나 마음에 아로 새기는  연주\n큰 위로와 평안과 감동을 주는 연주\n감사해요~~~~♡♡♡', '나였으면 곡과 곡사이 박수 안치는거 알지만 저자리에서 기립박수에 소리질렀을듯', '아니 말그대로 초절기교 연습곡인데 왜 눈물이나지? 에튀드의 한계를 넘었네', 'OMFG', 'one of the best interpretations of WJ, the middle part is played heavenly and the rhythm is amazing!

RACHMANINOV Prelude in G Major, op. 32, no. 5

About Seokyoung Hong
“I hope to be a pianist that can remind and somehow transfer the audience’s own personal stories. From those reminded experiences, I hope they find happiness, relief, and even nostalgia. Beyond thinking about the stories from the past, I also hope they can imagine lots of things while and after listening to my performance.”

Seokyoung Hong has had several first or second-place finishes at international competitions in Korea, Switzerland, and the United States. Following two years at the Yewon School in his native Seoul, he moved to Boston in 2022 to study piano at the New England Conservatory Preparatory School with HaeSun Paik while also attending the Walnut Hill School for the Arts. He’s found himself inspired by his new environment: “Nature inspires me in various ways—its huge size, marvelous detail, the beauty of nature itself, and a lot more. For instance, the enormous entities like the ocean and the universe motivate me but also make me feel that I am only a small human.” Seokyoung finds inspiration and motivation from the two most recent winners of the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, South Korea’s Yekwon Sunwoo and Yunchan Lim, which was part of his motivation for taking part in the Cliburn Junior. He also hopes to develop his piano playing and artistry, as well as to build experience performing for large audiences. His interest in composing leads him to constantly study, he says, but he also enjoys riding his bike, playing chess, and participating in the table tennis club at school.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvlTlpQ1wgM,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['미쳤다 ㅠ ㅠ 너무 좋아요...', '진짜 멋진 피아니스트입니다. 홍석영, 이제 세상이 기억합니다.', ""Very, very beautiful interpretation.

ABOUT RIE
After earning her B.A. in international politics, economics, and business from Tokyo’s Aoyama Gakuin University, Rie Moore spent a decade working in Japan in various marketing, translation, and executive assistant positions at major international companies, including Microsoft, Starbucks, and Nissan. During that time, she also returned to piano lessons after a 10-year hiatus—but the nature of her career made dedication to music extremely difficult.

YUNCHAN LIM, 2022 Cliburn Gold Medalist
South Korea  I  Age 18

LISZT 12 Transcendental Etudes

Yunchan Lim launched onto the international music stage when he was 14. He won second prize and the Chopin Special Award in his first-ever competition, the Cleveland International Piano Competition for Young Artists in 2018. That same year, he stood out as the youngest participant in the Cooper International Competition, where he won the third prize and the audience prize, which provided the opportunity for him to perform with the Cleveland Orchestra. 2019 meant more accolades, when, at the age of 15, he was the youngest to win Korea’s IsangYun International Competition, where he also took home two special prizes.
 
Now just 18, he has performed across South Korea—including with the Korean Orchestra Festival, Korea Symphony, Suwon Philharmonic, and Busan Philharmonic Orchestras, among others—as well as in Madrid, at the invitation of the Korea Cultural Center in Spain. He also participated in the recording of “2020 Young Musicians of Korea,” organized by the Korean Broadcasting System and released that November. 
 
A native of Siheung, Yunchan currently studies at the Korea National University of Arts under Minsoo Sohn. Coming to Fort Worth, he says he is “looking forward to playing in front of the warmest and most passionate audience in the world.”",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANCV3uG1GBg,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['영상뿐만 아니라 댓글도 아름답네요', 'this piece, performer, and piece resonate with me so much, this is so good…. we should be proud as the human race to reach this point it feels like…', '18 years old young man !!!

YUNCHAN LIM, 2022 Cliburn Gold Medalist
South Korea  I  Age 18

LISZT 12 Transcendental Etudes

Yunchan Lim launched onto the international music stage when he was 14. He won second prize and the Chopin Special Award in his first-ever competition, the Cleveland International Piano Competition for Young Artists in 2018. That same year, he stood out as the youngest participant in the Cooper International Competition, where he won the third prize and the audience prize, which provided the opportunity for him to perform with the Cleveland Orchestra. 2019 meant more accolades, when, at the age of 15, he was the youngest to win Korea’s IsangYun International Competition, where he also took home two special prizes.
 
Now just 18, he has performed across South Korea—including with the Korean Orchestra Festival, Korea Symphony, Suwon Philharmonic, and Busan Philharmonic Orchestras, among others—as well as in Madrid, at the invitation of the Korea Cultural Center in Spain. He also participated in the recording of “2020 Young Musicians of Korea,” organized by the Korean Broadcasting System and released that November. 
 
A native of Siheung, Yunchan currently studies at the Korea National University of Arts under Minsoo Sohn. Coming to Fort Worth, he says he is “looking forward to playing in front of the warmest and most passionate audience in the world.”",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uk6qyGFYJ9M,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,

The idea of Szafarnia Piano Competition was born in 1992, when the first nationwide competition was held. The subsequent editions already have had an international profile. Since that time, each year the competition becomes the first step to a musical career for many young pianists.

From year to year, volunteers and participants coming from almost every corner of the world gather in Szafarnia.
Musical efforts are assessed by the Jury including distinguished pianists and music professors from international music academies. The participants are young pianists between the age of 6 and 16. Their program is presented in three age categories (first – up to 10 years of age, the second – up to 13, the third – up to 16). The competition is open to all pianists who are not the students of state-owned music schools.

The idea behind the International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition for Children and Youth is a common experience of music for the young pianists from around the world, an exchange of experience and a chance for a better understanding over cultural differences possible with the universal language of music.

2022 Cliburn Gold Medalist

BACH – “Ricercar a 3” from The Musical Offering, BWV 1079


In June 2022, Yunchan Lim became the youngest person ever to win gold at the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition; his performances throughout showcased a “magical ability” and a “natural, instinctive quality” (La Scena) that astounded listeners around the world. The depth of his artistry and connection to listeners also secured him the Audience Award and Best Performance of a New Work (for Sir Stephen Hough’s Fanfare Toccata). 
 
Just 18 years old, Yunchan’s ascent to international stardom has been meteoric. His final Cliburn Competition appearance with Rachmaninov’s Piano Concerto No. 3 delivered the defining moment of the three-week event; as one critic noted: “The applause that followed was endless: a star had emerged before our eyes” (Seen and Heard International). The video of that performance trended globally on YouTube in the days after, reaching #25, and has now become the most-watched version of that piece on the platform, amassing more than 5.5 million views in just one month. 

Yunchan has performed across his native South Korea—including with the Korean Orchestra Festival, Korea Symphony, Suwon Philharmonic, and Busan Philharmonic Orchestras, among others—as well as in Madrid, at the invitation of the Korea Cultural Center in Spain. His 2022–2023 inaugural tour as Cliburn winner takes him across four continents, with highlights including the Aspen Music Festival, La Jolla Music Society, and Performing Arts Houston in the United States; Seoul Arts Center, National Concert Hall in Taipei, and the KBS and Korean National Symphony Orchestras in Asia; and recital tours in Europe and South America.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX4_CwLcl4M,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['아름다운 가락의 시를 읊조리며 연주하는 모습이 숭고하기까지 하네요 부라보~', '콩쿨영상 하도 봐서 그때 오케스트라단원하고도 정들어버림요 ㅋㅋ 그때 바이올린 연주자 플롯. 등 연주하시는 분은 다른 소속이신듯요 😅', '임윤찬 피아니스트🎹\n늘 사랑하고 응원합니다🤍.', '언제 들어도 마음의 평화와 안정을 가져다 주는 Bach\n복잡한 화음, 현란한 테크닉, 웅장한 감동, 이런 것 없이도\n얼마든지 마음에 와 닿는 Bach 음악,\n임윤찬이 매우 잘 표현하여 다시한번 Bach를 생각한다', '윤찬림 바흐는 진짜 바흐 같아,,,,, 그,,, 다들 뭔 말인지 알죠??', ""I didn't notice this before but today I see that Yunchan was pouring out his soul to the play.

Hence, due to all the sympathetic resonance when the dampers are raised, you simply can\'t make out (let alone appreciate) the polyphony properly. Yet just about everyone in the comments is literally raving about the wonderful playing!\n\nNo, I\'m not some Bach purist insisting on NO PEDAL! in Bach EVER! because that\'s of course wrong as well. But if you can\'t hear that the vast majority of Bach\'s harpsichord music when played on the piano simply doesn\'t require pedal and using it is in fact detrimental to the desired effect, then you\'re not much of a musician.\n\nUnfortunately nowadays if you make not pressing the wrong keys pretty much your main and only goal, provided you achieve this you\'re immediately declared a genius. Thanks piano/music competitions, you\'ve really done piano playing, music making and society as a whole a great (dis) service...As a result we have this here playing en masse declared as amazing!\n\nIn reality this young man doesn\'t even understand the concept of legato playing yet. And how could he? He\'s literally sitting in the clouds, just placing his hands at the keyboard his wrists are almost at full extension. His physical approach is fundamental blockade to any kind of hammer velocity control, i.e. he\'s failed at the first.\n\nAnd it\'s all patently obvious just listening to his incessantly monotonous playing, you don\'t need the video....\n\nWell, I say ""you"", but judging by the overwhelming deluge of irate replies my comment is about to generate for daring to state all this, perhaps it\'s not really ""you""...', ""Actually his hand position grants him a greater dynamic range than most pianists. His tendons are in a diagonal position due to the lowering of his wrist which allows him to play softer. When he played louder he raises his wrists. Listen to his Brahms ballades he played at the Chopin festival.\n\nAnd Bach on piano is already a mistake to begin with. But unfortunately the competition requires baroque music and they aren't hauling out a harpsichord. The pedal can actually increase the resonance and create a richer sound. Maybe that's what Yunchan was wanting. But of course its not gonna sound faithful to bach - it's on the piano. No other composer creates these kind negative comments from being played on a piano except bach. Just accept that it's not piano music and don't attack artists in a cheeky way because it's never going to sound amazing on a piano no matter how good he plays it. It's possible the piece wasn't even written for a dynamic instrument. But you probably already know this and just want to be cheeky. At the end of the day I would still rather listen to this then glenn gould."", ""\xa0@synestheticpiano\xa0 It's not about not using the pedal at all, no matter what, when playing Bach on the piano. Like I said in my OP, I'm not a purist. Far from it. However, for anyone with a discerning ear it should be quite obvious that you'll be using the pedal quite sparingly, if at all, in all of Bach. Bach's keyboard music simply doesn't sound good if you pedal it like it's Brahms or such (for reasons I won't go into now in the interest of brevity) and if you can't hear that then there's something not quite right about your music making.\n\nAs far as the height he's sitting at, it's too high and that's an anatomical reality. Our wrists/hands/fingers have a particular range of motion. There's a limit to the flexion and extension (unless you're made of rubber) and sitting as high as he is he's very much on the limit of his wrist/hand/finger extension 90% of the time. I realise the extra help from gravity we get when we sit high might feel reassuring and provide a feeling of greater control, but it leads to poor technique/locked wrists. It's simply impossible to reliably control hammer velocity like that.\n\nAnd it shows in his playing. The reason it's ignored is because he's achieved his one and only goal: try and not to miss a key, which seems to be the be all and end all of playing the piano nowadays.  If he actually attempted to play in a way which would make sense musically his playing would fall apart.\n\nLike I said, this boy is just another example of the trend, but he's certainly not unique. This has been going on for decades. Just listen to Krystian Zimerman and you'll understand everything. The man has made a stellar career based on playing completely devoid of any kind of musicality. Lauded for having a great technique when in reality he can't maintain a steady beat, let alone play legato. Feel free to listen to him playing the Fuge of the 2nd Partita's first movement and hear him accelerate out of control. Not mention a complete lack of any kind of phrasing - the only nuance being the difference between forte and piano playing, which (by the way) he clearly achieved mostly by using the una corda.\n\nIf this trend doesn't change soon we're in danger of completely losing the little audience still left listening to piano recitals.\n\nAt a minimum I suggest we start with the juries of these major competitions. Although dismantling the competitions themselves is the real solution..."", '\xa0@zvelekva\xa0 So you don’t like Krystian Zimmerman either. I think his dynamics in Chopin is very good but agree he’s not rhythmically perfect. But please listen to Yunchan Lim’s brahms op 10 no 4 and tell me what you think. Yunchan’s biggest strength for me is his balance and creating a beautiful sound. This of course, is not appreciable with Bach on the piano. His Brahms is not bland like most pianists and he achieves beautiful pianissimo sound without the use of Una Corda. And actually, that statement about hitting the right notes makes me question your whole opinion because it’s clear the Yunchan’s focus is on the sentiment of the music and not just technical virtuosity. If what you desire in classical music is accurate, authentic timing and dynamics I actually think Yunchan offers that in romantic music. But of course you have to actually listen to him to make that conclusion…', ""Seymour Bernstein, after listening to Yun Chan's Bach, commented that it was a magnificent interpretation of the greatest artist of the century."", '신적이다.', ""Il n'y a pas de mot , cette interprétation s'infiltre en nous et élève notre âme dans un autre monde ,\xa0\nYunchan Lim n'interprète pas, il est la musique , que le ciel préserve ce trésor qui nous est offert .\nThere is no word, this interpretation seeps into us and lifts our soul into another world,\nYunchan Lim does not interpret, he is the music, may heaven preserve this treasure offered to us.\n말이 없다, 이 해석은 우리에게 스며들어 우리의 영혼을 다른 세계로 끌어올린다.\n임윤찬은 해석하지 않는다. 그는 음악이다. 우리에게 주어진 이 보물을 하늘이 지켜주길."", 'Je suis tout à fait d""accord!!! un tésor pour le monde, une merveille !', '😍', '피아노 같지 않고 합시코드 인가요? 그런 소리가 들리네요:) 다른 곡에서는 현악기 소리를 내더니~ 같은 피아노에서 이런 소리가 날수있군요🥰', ""Je suis heureux d'être vivant et d'avoir assisté à l'éclosion d'un tel génie de l'interprétation."", 'Moi comme vous.

According to Mr. Minsoo Sohn, his current teacher, Yunchan tries very hard to find solutions before he comes to teacher to discuss a musical piece in their sessions.  Yunchan is a voracious absorber of many great masters of the past such as Horowitz.  But what truly distinguishes him from many other cookie-cutter pianists of modern day is his effort to connect directly to illustrious composers like Bach, Mozart, Beethoven.  He does not copy from other pianists, even his respected teacher.  Actually he said in an interview that he tries to concentrate on original scores rather than following conventional interpretations.  Probably that's why he seems to have unique voices in each and every piece he plays."", ""\xa0@bsghill\xa0 Do you know the first teacher's name?"", 'KAY KYUNG EUN KIM, was his first teacher?', ""Here's what I found out about his teachers from different interviews: When Yunchan decided to audition for Prodigy Academy(at 8), his first teacher at the local piano academy didn't even know such thing existed. Yunchan found out about Prodigy Academy while watching TV. He asked his mom to take him to audition. His mom said that she saw a metronome for the first time at Prodigy Academy. Kyung Eun Kim at Prodigy Academy must be his second teacher.  She did her best as a teacher. She later introduced him to the Korean University of Arts prodigy center (at 13) so that he can take more advanced courses.  Yunchan met his current teacher, Minsoo Sohn there.\n\nMr. Sohn is the one who influenced him the most. Yunchan even described Mr. Sohn as his life savior. His style perhaps is different because Mr. Sohn is not pushing him a certain style. He just lets Yunchan find his own way by introducing him the great pianists of 1900s and many books to read. Yunchan basically learned by studying the pianists of the past. When he was younger,  he was a little rebellious that he had to play a piece he wanted to play even if his teacher said it's too difficult for him. He's playful only with his friends. He's almost silent and doesn't respond much while taking lessons, so Mr. Sohn worries about him being too introverted.  Then Mr. Sohn is surprised when he finds out that Yunchan listened very carefully and followed what he was told to do. Watching Yunchan on stage is also shocking for him because Yunchan is totally a different person on stage."", '\xa0@music_clips23\xa0 What books?', ""\xa0@davidjacobson9907\xa0   The first books he suggested him to read were Rilke's poetry and Heine's. From the most recent interview, Mr. Sohn suggested him to read The Journal of Eugène Delacroix, so he read it and it was the most enjoyable book he's ever read. From a previous interview, he read Non-Possession by Beopjeong(a Buddhist monk). It seems like Mr. Sohn usually recommends his students books on humanities rather than piano techniques."", ""\xa0@music_clips23\xa0 these books won't help him play. The first teacher studied with every big name Russian pianist in Europe. Why isn't she mentioned?"", ""\u200b\xa0@davidjacobson9907\xa0  Are you a friend of the female teacher or what?😀I've read her interview. She obviously helped him grow. But in different interviews, it's Mr. Sohn who made him decide to become a pianist and influenced him the most. You'd like to know how he learned his technique, right? Here's what I found out from his interviews:\nDuring the past 3 years (Covid pandemic), he basically practiced at home 7 hours a day by listening and studying the old pianists. Before he started to take lessons from Mr. Sohn, he didn't know about all those old pianists and his favorite pianist was Kissin. Now his favorite pianists are Horowitz, Neuhaus, Fischer, Friedman, Cortot, Egorov, sofronitsky, Lipatti, etc. He learned by trial and error. So, he basically developed his technique by studying the old pianists. He doesn't recommend other people to practice like he did. He was burnt out and depressed while practicing at home like that. Mr. Sohn's teaching method is image storytelling, helping him visualize a scene while playing. He developed musicality from Mr.Sohn."", '\xa0@music_clips23\xa0 No one even mentions her name. She obviously formed him, but is probably not politically connected. So he never mentions her because the present teacher would be upset.', 'Yes! Yunchan plays like Yunchan !

J. S. Bach - Prelude and Fugue No. 3 in C-sharp major BWV 848


The idea of Szafarnia Piano Competition was born in 1992, when the first nationwide competition was held. The subsequent editions already have had an international profile. Since that time, each year the competition becomes the first step to a musical career for many young pianists.

From year to year, volunteers and participants coming from almost every corner of the world gather in Szafarnia.
Musical efforts are assessed by the Jury including distinguished pianists and music professors from international music academies. The participants are young pianists between the age of 6 and 16. Their program is presented in three age categories (first – up to 10 years of age, the second – up to 13, the third – up to 16). The competition is open to all pianists who are not the students of state-owned music schools.

The idea behind the International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition for Children and Youth is a common experience of music for the young pianists from around the world, an exchange of experience and a chance for a better understanding over cultural differences possible with the universal language of music.

The idea of Szafarnia Piano Competition was born in 1992, when the first nationwide competition was held. The subsequent editions already have had an international profile. Since that time, each year the competition becomes the first step to a musical career for many young pianists.

From year to year, volunteers and participants coming from almost every corner of the world gather in Szafarnia.
Musical efforts are assessed by the Jury including distinguished pianists and music professors from international music academies. The participants are young pianists between the age of 6 and 16. Their program is presented in three age categories (first – up to 10 years of age, the second – up to 13, the third – up to 16). The competition is open to all pianists who are not the students of state-owned music schools.

The idea behind the International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition for Children and Youth is a common experience of music for the young pianists from around the world, an exchange of experience and a chance for a better understanding over cultural differences possible with the universal language of music.

YUNCHAN LIM, 2022 Cliburn Gold Medalist
South Korea  I  Age 18

LISZT 12 Transcendental Etudes

Yunchan Lim launched onto the international music stage when he was 14. He won second prize and the Chopin Special Award in his first-ever competition, the Cleveland International Piano Competition for Young Artists in 2018. That same year, he stood out as the youngest participant in the Cooper International Competition, where he won the third prize and the audience prize, which provided the opportunity for him to perform with the Cleveland Orchestra. 2019 meant more accolades, when, at the age of 15, he was the youngest to win Korea’s IsangYun International Competition, where he also took home two special prizes.
 
Now just 18, he has performed across South Korea—including with the Korean Orchestra Festival, Korea Symphony, Suwon Philharmonic, and Busan Philharmonic Orchestras, among others—as well as in Madrid, at the invitation of the Korea Cultural Center in Spain. He also participated in the recording of “2020 Young Musicians of Korea,” organized by the Korean Broadcasting System and released that November. 
 
A native of Siheung, Yunchan currently studies at the Korea National University of Arts under Minsoo Sohn. Coming to Fort Worth, he says he is “looking forward to playing in front of the warmest and most passionate audience in the world.”",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr2C6nc4iiM,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['He is a great pianist', ""Next to Richter's rendition!"", 'Fantastic!', '5:56 이 곡에서 앞선 모든 곡들의 최종이 터지는 듯', '머리카락이 눈찌르겠누', '💕💕💕', '12곡들 사이에 숨겨진 명곡', '기억속 어딘가에 이미 잊었다고 여겼던 숨어있던 꿈을 꺼내준 곡입니다.\n듣고 들으며 혼자서 다짐하고 또 다짐하게 되네요.\n희소병으로 먼저간 내동생 진영이,\n소아마비로 아픈 다리를 이끌고 등교길을 함께했던 내 첫 친구 리라에게\n비록 그땐 어려서 구하지도 제대로 돕지도 못했지만 \n마음에 담은 소명을 반드시 이뤄서 더 크게 더 많이 돕도록 할께.\n어디서든 평안하길 빈다.', '2:51  4:02  5:05', '5:12 이 부분 뭔가 열정을 향해 달려가는것 같아요\n임윤찬님의 표현력을 뼈까지 깊게 느낄수 있었던 부분 같아요\n또 표정과 손동작에 절실함이 담겨있는것 같아요', '임윤찬은 악마이다. 임윤찬 이후로 나는 더 이상 다른 연주자의 음악을 즐길 수 없게 되었다.', '초절기교11번 최애곡이에요. 밤의선율 제목도 딱이에요. 정말 고요하고 진한 밤하늘에 별빛이 반짝이는 모습이 연상이되는데 다이아몬드를 흩뿌려 놓듯이 너무나 아름다워서 눈물이 차올라요. 가슴 속에서 뭔지 모를 무언가가 내 속이 꽉 채워주고 황홀경에 빠져들게 만들어요. 1년이 지나도 감동이 사라지질 않아요ㅠㅠ', 'The music of Faso is an inexhaustible source of sweetness.\nIt allows us to plunge deep inside ourselves and at the same time resonate with our fellow man, Yé Lassina Coulibaly❤❤❤❤❤', '6:42', 'I think this is my favourite though the tremolos in Chasse-neige got me.', '1:55 6:38 6:43 😊', '6:42', '쇼팽에서 리스트로 바뀐 순간', '눈물날거같네....', '초절기교는 들을 때마다 뭔가 부담스러워서 좋아하지 않았는데... 최애곡이 되어버렸다.. 임윤찬의 마법..', 'Whenever I practice, I would just listen to this magnificent recording!', ""He's at the level of Rachmaninoff, Hoffman, Nyiregyhazi, Heinrich Neuhaus, at only 18.."", '5:11 Taking off.

So far the best pianist I have heard in this competition. Pure music, every note brings a different dynamic. Based on what I heard she was the most voted by the public. The audience can't be wrong. Honestly she is the only pianist that I managed to listen to the entire version for the beauty of her playing."", ""I can't believe she didn't get any medal.. i'm very disappointed with the results of this competition and i think i'm not the only one, because she has turned to be the most voted competitor by the public of the internet live broadcast.\nbesides, none of the 2009 prize winners can even be compared to olga kern or alexander kobrin."", ""I love her!\nShe's a musician through and through, articulate and true.\nWonderful!"", ""Stravinsky made the arrangement for Rubinstein who thought the piano writing so convoluted that he refused to play it. Many professional pianists tweak it, adding and omitting notes because it really isn't pianistic in the way,say, Rach 3 which although difficult lies under the fingers. It is rare to hear such a clean and musically clear performance as this. GREAT piano playing and very exciting."", 'Very nice! Well played. It\'s a pity though the sound distorts sometimes. Was there also a ""live tv"" channel of the competition?\nGreetings, Rolf, netherlands\nYou can reach me on Twitter as @otterhouse', 'Mariangela sei un MITO !!!!', 'Fantastica, energia e controllo per una performance mozzafiato. Peccato per la bassa qualita audio della registrazione.', 'This is indeed very good.  Most live performance of this piece I have heard suffers (in my mind) by comparison with the implausibly accurate old recording of the work by Maurizio Pollini - but her playing has real strength and pace.', 'brillliant.', 'Beautiful playing. Impressive...']"

Now a respected and well-published emergency medicine physician, he holds a position at Arlington Memorial Hospital.

He won second prize and the Chopin Special Award in his first-ever competition, the Cleveland International Piano Competition for Young Artists in 2018. That same year, he stood out as the youngest participant in the Cooper International Competition, where he won the third prize and the audience prize, which provided the opportunity for him to perform with the Cleveland Orchestra. 2019 meant more accolades, when, at the age of 15, he was the youngest to win Korea’s IsangYun International Competition, where he also took home two special prizes.
 
Now just 18, he has performed across South Korea—including with the Korean Orchestra Festival, Korea Symphony, Suwon Philharmonic, and Busan Philharmonic Orchestras, among others—as well as in Madrid, at the invitation of the Korea Cultural Center in Spain. He also participated in the recording of “2020 Young Musicians of Korea,” organized by the Korean Broadcasting System and released that November. 
 
A native of Siheung, Yunchan currently studies at the Korea National University of Arts under Minsoo Sohn. Coming to Fort Worth, he says he is “looking forward to playing in front of the warmest and most passionate audience in the world.”",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBSYHnjvFjk,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"[""I am tired just watching him execute those interlocking chords!!!

Eugeny Kissen had Listz in mind as did many great pianists. Yuchan is amazing especially for his age, but I wish his fans would not go off the deep end. There are others who have played the Listz etudes beautifully and virtuostically. As an appreciator these masterpieces remain compelling because each musician brings something different even to these overplayed works. Musicians work too hard to be dismissed by an assumption that only Yuchan Lim has the passion and technique to play Listz. I wonder how such adulation affects the young pianist. Being excited to follow his career,    grateful for his dedication and G-d given talent - even a bit of rhapsodic praise is expected when young talent comes on the scene. As I write this, several young Koreans are preparing to emerge and amaze us yet again. While Yuchan probably does not read youtube comments, placing unrealistic expectations on one so young, now caught up in a whirlwind of activity as a result of winning a prestigious competition (constant travel for performances, interviews) - far from Yuchan Lim's stated desire to practice the piano in the Korean countryside and not being driven by fame (or whatever he said in his interview after placing 1st). YouTube is a blessing but vapid comparisons are becoming tiresome. Important to not to forget the genius composers! Perhaps Yuchan Lim will turn out to be one of the greatest pianists of his time. Even so, remaining open to the worldwide music community is important (to me.)Music is after all the international language, and though we seem hopelessly divided along idealogical lines, music, even above other other art forms, plays a role in creating common ground."", ""Now I'm in tears in the shoes of Liszt...

YUNCHAN LIM, 2022 Cliburn Gold Medalist
South Korea  I  Age 18

LISZT 12 Transcendental Etudes

Yunchan Lim launched onto the international music stage when he was 14. He won second prize and the Chopin Special Award in his first-ever competition, the Cleveland International Piano Competition for Young Artists in 2018. That same year, he stood out as the youngest participant in the Cooper International Competition, where he won the third prize and the audience prize, which provided the opportunity for him to perform with the Cleveland Orchestra. 2019 meant more accolades, when, at the age of 15, he was the youngest to win Korea’s IsangYun International Competition, where he also took home two special prizes.
 
Now just 18, he has performed across South Korea—including with the Korean Orchestra Festival, Korea Symphony, Suwon Philharmonic, and Busan Philharmonic Orchestras, among others—as well as in Madrid, at the invitation of the Korea Cultural Center in Spain. He also participated in the recording of “2020 Young Musicians of Korea,” organized by the Korean Broadcasting System and released that November. 
 
A native of Siheung, Yunchan currently studies at the Korea National University of Arts under Minsoo Sohn. Coming to Fort Worth, he says he is “looking forward to playing in front of the warmest and most passionate audience in the world.”",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdqkIKwjD-4,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['0:04', '어리지만 존경한다', 'Bravo🎉', 'Hard, technical and excellent piece', '빨리 음반 내주세요', '빨라서 손가락이 보이지 않을 정도인데 또렷하게 들리는게  신기합니다.', '고통스럽게 아름다운', '1:50부터- 손가락의 움직임이.. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻', '임윤찬님의 초절기교는 그냥 눈물입니다 듣는 내내 눈물만 납니다', 'Just awed….', '2:09~2:11\nBreathtaking', '블루레이 내주세요', 'Amazing  👏 🙀 😮', '지금도 연습중일듯 ..', '덕분에 리스트  음악을 사랑하게 되었어요.😉', 'https://youtu.be/HU2ts-s92ZU', '감동 감동 😭', '2. 도화선 (Molto Vivace): 양손이 엇박자로 빠르게 진행되는 고난도의 연습곡. 특히 Pretissimo 부분은 인템포로 정확히 쳐내기가 거의 불가능에 가까울 정도이다. 끝부분에는 웬만한 곡에서 찾아보기 힘든 5화음까지 등장한다. \n나무위키', '설명 감사합니다!', '\xa0@sydneyk3979\xa0 ^^ 제가 더 감사합니다!☺️🙏', '초절기교 전곡을 택한 과감함, 용기에 박수를.보냅니다!!', 'I remember some people at the livestreaming were skeptic until this point, a few even laughed at his choice of performing ""all"" the 12  études. \nAnd what?

Music also is not visible, and I think it is one of the very few real / true ones in this world. It\'s the reason I will keep pursuing music for the rest of my life.""\n(Before the final) ""I do not care whether I win or not, I\'ll just try my best to seek and deliver the heritage/legacy of the great musicians of the past to this age.""\n\nHe also said his purpose of playing the piano is to express the pain deep inside us and to heal people, again with music. ""Music (played by me) can\'t deceive people so I always try to have a genuinely compassionate and understanding heart toward human beings and the world.""\n\nHe often deliberately cuts himself from modern things or social media to fully communicate with the original composer and his intent, and be immersed in the music itself.  \nHe said there\'s a lava-like singing inside him but to perfectly express that music he needs to struggle for a long time, study and think a lot, and practice overnight, to go beyond the skills to the realm of pure art..\n\nHe also said that though he lives in this century, his mind is living in the 19th with the great minds of that time. He is inspired by lots of old literature as well as everyday incidents. For example, he read the Divine Comedy of Dante countless times and searched lots of foreign documentaries to play a piece of Liszt.', ""He said that the most inspired poet is Rainer Maria Rilke.. and Dongju-Yoon, Korean poet who died in prison during the Japanese occupation..\n\n\nPrelude\n\nLet me have no shame\nunder heaven, 'til I die.\n\nEven wind in the leaves\npained my soul.\n\nWith a heart that sings of stars\nI must love all dying things.\n\nAnd I must walk the path\ngiven to me.\n\nTonight also,\nthe wind sweeps over the stars."", '들어도 들어도,\n 감동의 눈물만 흐르네요~!']"

Preliminary Round Recital

Van Cliburn Concert Hall at TCU

YUNCHAN LIM
2022 Cliburn Gold Medalist
South Korea  I  Age 18

COUPERIN – “La Couperin” from Pièces de clavecin, Book IV, order 21


In June 2022, Yunchan Lim became the youngest person ever to win gold at the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition; his performances throughout showcased a “magical ability” and a “natural, instinctive quality” (La Scena) that astounded listeners around the world. The depth of his artistry and connection to listeners also secured him the Audience Award and Best Performance of a New Work (for Sir Stephen Hough’s Fanfare Toccata). 
 
Just 18 years old, Yunchan’s ascent to international stardom has been meteoric. His final Cliburn Competition appearance with Rachmaninov’s Piano Concerto No. 3 delivered the defining moment of the three-week event; as one critic noted: “The applause that followed was endless: a star had emerged before our eyes” (Seen and Heard International). The video of that performance trended globally on YouTube in the days after, reaching #25, and has now become the most-watched version of that piece on the platform, amassing more than 5.5 million views in just one month. 

Yunchan has performed across his native South Korea—including with the Korean Orchestra Festival, Korea Symphony, Suwon Philharmonic, and Busan Philharmonic Orchestras, among others—as well as in Madrid, at the invitation of the Korea Cultural Center in Spain. His 2022–2023 inaugural tour as Cliburn winner takes him across four continents, with highlights including the Aspen Music Festival, La Jolla Music Society, and Performing Arts Houston in the United States; Seoul Arts Center, National Concert Hall in Taipei, and the KBS and Korean National Symphony Orchestras in Asia; and recital tours in Europe and South America.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKnrheyD2k,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,

Remember: Watch all videos at cliburn.org/amateurspotlight.

Hideko Tazawa began studying classical piano as a young child in her native Tokyo. When she entered Waseda University, her pianistic pursuits shifted to jazz; she performed regularly with an amateur jazz band. After receiving her bachelor’s degree in earth sciences, she went on to a successful, now 40-year career and currently serves in a supply chain management role for several foreign-based manufacturing and Japanese trading companies. She returned to classical music in 2000, saying she “wanted to realize her dream which she kept from 5 years old.” That commitment has led her to a number of performances and competition awards in Japan over the past two decades. Her festival participation in the Cliburn Amateur will mark her first international competition experience, and she’s hoping to “have a global experience” and “to know the worldwide competitors’ way of thinking for their performance and music” in order “to expand and develop” her own playing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxKsXipagZQ,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['A beautiful performance!

About Seokyoung Hong
“I hope to be a pianist that can remind and somehow transfer the audience’s own personal stories. From those reminded experiences, I hope they find happiness, relief, and even nostalgia. Beyond thinking about the stories from the past, I also hope they can imagine lots of things while and after listening to my performance.”

Seokyoung Hong has had several first or second-place finishes at international competitions in Korea, Switzerland, and the United States. Following two years at the Yewon School in his native Seoul, he moved to Boston in 2022 to study piano at the New England Conservatory Preparatory School with HaeSun Paik while also attending the Walnut Hill School for the Arts. He’s found himself inspired by his new environment: “Nature inspires me in various ways—its huge size, marvelous detail, the beauty of nature itself, and a lot more. For instance, the enormous entities like the ocean and the universe motivate me but also make me feel that I am only a small human.” Seokyoung finds inspiration and motivation from the two most recent winners of the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, South Korea’s Yekwon Sunwoo and Yunchan Lim, which was part of his motivation for taking part in the Cliburn Junior. He also hopes to develop his piano playing and artistry, as well as to build experience performing for large audiences. His interest in composing leads him to constantly study, he says, but he also enjoys riding his bike, playing chess, and participating in the table tennis club at school.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOyFdpeSpWE,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['클라이번은 홍석영 카테고리만 만들어 달라^^', 'Incredible pianist.']"

The idea of Szafarnia Piano Competition was born in 1992, when the first nationwide competition was held. The subsequent editions already have had an international profile. Since that time, each year the competition becomes the first step to a musical career for many young pianists.

From year to year, volunteers and participants coming from almost every corner of the world gather in Szafarnia.
Musical efforts are assessed by the Jury including distinguished pianists and music professors from international music academies. The participants are young pianists between the age of 6 and 16. Their program is presented in three age categories (first – up to 10 years of age, the second – up to 13, the third – up to 16). The competition is open to all pianists who are not the students of state-owned music schools.

The idea behind the International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition for Children and Youth is a common experience of music for the young pianists from around the world, an exchange of experience and a chance for a better understanding over cultural differences possible with the universal language of music.

YUNCHAN LIM, 2022 Cliburn Gold Medalist
South Korea  I  Age 18

LISZT 12 Transcendental Etudes

Yunchan Lim launched onto the international music stage when he was 14. He won second prize and the Chopin Special Award in his first-ever competition, the Cleveland International Piano Competition for Young Artists in 2018. That same year, he stood out as the youngest participant in the Cooper International Competition, where he won the third prize and the audience prize, which provided the opportunity for him to perform with the Cleveland Orchestra. 2019 meant more accolades, when, at the age of 15, he was the youngest to win Korea’s IsangYun International Competition, where he also took home two special prizes.
 
Now just 18, he has performed across South Korea—including with the Korean Orchestra Festival, Korea Symphony, Suwon Philharmonic, and Busan Philharmonic Orchestras, among others—as well as in Madrid, at the invitation of the Korea Cultural Center in Spain. He also participated in the recording of “2020 Young Musicians of Korea,” organized by the Korean Broadcasting System and released that November. 
 
A native of Siheung, Yunchan currently studies at the Korea National University of Arts under Minsoo Sohn.

Fryderyka Chopina dla Dzieci i Młodzieży, Szafarnia 2015",20150509,87,1310,5,,0,"Pomysł szafarskich Konkursów Pianistycznych narodził się w 1992 roku. Wtedy to odbył się pierwszy konkurs o zasięgu krajowym, kolejne edycje miały już charakter międzynarodowy. Dla wielu młodych pianistów były pierwszym krokiem do muzycznej kariery i tak jest do dnia dzisiejszego. 

Z roku na rok przybywa chętnych i pojawiają się uczestnicy niemal z każdego zakątka świata. Muzyczne zmagania ocenia jury złożone z wybitnych pianistów i profesorów uczelni muzycznych z Polski i z zagranicy. Biorą w nim udział młodzi pianiści w wieku od 6 do 16 lat, swój program prezentują w trzech kategoriach wiekowych (pierwsza – do lat 10, druga – do lat 13, trzecia – do lat 16). Konkurs jest otwarty dla pianistów niebędących uczniami Państwowych Szkół Muzycznych. 

Ideą Międzynarodowego Konkursu Pianistycznego im. Fryderyka Chopina dla Dzieci i Młodzieży w Szafarni jest wspólne spotkanie młodych pianistów z całego świata, wymiana doświadczeń i porozumienie ponad różnicami kulturowymi, dzięki uniwersalnemu językowi, jakim jest muzyka.

2023 Cliburn International Junior Piano Competition and Festival
Preliminary Round Recital
Thursday, June 8, 2023
Caruth Auditorium at SMU  I  Dallas, Texas USA


LISZT Concert Etude No. 2 “La leggierezza”


About Seokyoung Hong
“I hope to be a pianist that can remind and somehow transfer the audience’s own personal stories. From those reminded experiences, I hope they find happiness, relief, and even nostalgia. Beyond thinking about the stories from the past, I also hope they can imagine lots of things while and after listening to my performance.”

Seokyoung Hong has had several first or second-place finishes at international competitions in Korea, Switzerland, and the United States. Following two years at the Yewon School in his native Seoul, he moved to Boston in 2022 to study piano at the New England Conservatory Preparatory School with HaeSun Paik while also attending the Walnut Hill School for the Arts. He’s found himself inspired by his new environment: “Nature inspires me in various ways—its huge size, marvelous detail, the beauty of nature itself, and a lot more. For instance, the enormous entities like the ocean and the universe motivate me but also make me feel that I am only a small human.” Seokyoung finds inspiration and motivation from the two most recent winners of the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, South Korea’s Yekwon Sunwoo and Yunchan Lim, which was part of his motivation for taking part in the Cliburn Junior. He also hopes to develop his piano playing and artistry, as well as to build experience performing for large audiences. His interest in composing leads him to constantly study, he says, but he also enjoys riding his bike, playing chess, and participating in the table tennis club at school.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndRQFmMKNCI,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['Beautiful round & sinuous melodic line ❤', '나 진짜 임윤찬만 들을 거라고 했었음. 그 맹세 깨기로 함.', '아  자꾸 듣고 싶어지네요❤\n석영군 그대의 앞날이 너무나 기대됩니다 ❤❤❤\n언젠가 한국에서 공연을 한다면 꼭 가서   아름다운 음악에 빠지고 싶네요❤❤❤', '""가벼움을"" 사랑합니다!', '😂🇮🇷', '이곡 진짜 좋아하는데 연주 너무 좋아요 😧', 'Superb both technically and musically.', '연주짱']"

The subsequent editions already have had an international profile. Since that time, each year the competition becomes the first step to a musical career for many young pianists.

From year to year, volunteers and participants coming from almost every corner of the world gather in Szafarnia. 
Musical efforts are assessed by the Jury including distinguished pianists and music professors from international music academies. The participants are young pianists between the age of 6 and 16. Their program is presented in three age categories (first – up to 10 years of age, the second – up to 13, the third – up to 16). The competition is open to all pianists who are not the students of state-owned music schools. 

The idea behind the International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition for Children and Youth is a common experience of music for the young pianists from around the world, an exchange of experience and a chance for a better understanding over cultural differences possible with the universal language of music.

We'll be back tomorrow with our last Cliburn Kids of the spring season (don't worry: it'll be back the week of June 15!) and FOUR more Cliburn Amateur Spotlights, from Kyiv, El Durado Hills (CA), Montreal, and Niza (Japan). See you at facebook.com/thecliburn/live_videos or youtube.com/thecliburn!

Matthew Barnhill dreamt of being a pianist when he was a child. He earned a Bachelor of Music in piano performance from Furman University, and—though his career went a different direction (he’s worked in financial analysis since graduating with a master’s in accountancy in 2013)—that dream has never left him. His eye has been on the Cliburn Amateur for several years, waiting until he was old enough to enter. He sees it as a motivation and inspiration—“a path back into the world of music.” In addition to working as a manager of project finance and consulting for CohnReznick LLP, Matthew is an avid runner (his marathon count is in the double digits) and hiker (he summited Kilimanjaro in 2018).",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvXih3HKvGI,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,

HAYDN Sonata in E Major, Hob. XVI:31 (I)

About Seokyoung Hong
“I hope to be a pianist that can remind and somehow transfer the audience’s own personal stories. From those reminded experiences, I hope they find happiness, relief, and even nostalgia. Beyond thinking about the stories from the past, I also hope they can imagine lots of things while and after listening to my performance.”

Seokyoung Hong has had several first or second-place finishes at international competitions in Korea, Switzerland, and the United States. Following two years at the Yewon School in his native Seoul, he moved to Boston in 2022 to study piano at the New England Conservatory Preparatory School with HaeSun Paik while also attending the Walnut Hill School for the Arts. He’s found himself inspired by his new environment: “Nature inspires me in various ways—its huge size, marvelous detail, the beauty of nature itself, and a lot more. For instance, the enormous entities like the ocean and the universe motivate me but also make me feel that I am only a small human.” Seokyoung finds inspiration and motivation from the two most recent winners of the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, South Korea’s Yekwon Sunwoo and Yunchan Lim, which was part of his motivation for taking part in the Cliburn Junior. He also hopes to develop his piano playing and artistry, as well as to build experience performing for large audiences. His interest in composing leads him to constantly study, he says, but he also enjoys riding his bike, playing chess, and participating in the table tennis club at school.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ngU8i9DHHI,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,['와 좋아요\n음률이 하나하나 귀에 꽂히네요\nBeautiful !']

Anastasiya Shymchak - Belarus

J. S. Bach – Invention in A Major, BWV 783 00:00
F. Chopin – Waltz in A-flat major, Op. 69 No. 1 01:50
A. Tcherepnin – Bagatelle 05:30

The idea of Szafarnia Piano Competition was born in 1992, when the first nationwide competition was held. The subsequent editions already have had an international profile. Since that time, each year the competition becomes the first step to a musical career for many young pianists.

From year to year, volunteers and participants coming from almost every corner of the world gather in Szafarnia.
Musical efforts are assessed by the Jury including distinguished pianists and music professors from international music academies. The participants are young pianists between the age of 6 and 16. Their program is presented in three age categories (first – up to 10 years of age, the second – up to 13, the third – up to 16). The competition is open to all pianists who are not the students of state-owned music schools.

The idea behind the International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition for Children and Youth is a common experience of music for the young pianists from around the world, an exchange of experience and a chance for a better understanding over cultural differences possible with the universal language of music.

2023 Cliburn International Junior Piano Competition and Festival
Preliminary Round Recital

Caruth Auditorium at SMU  I  Dallas, Texas USA


PROKOFIEV Toccata in D Minor, op. 11

About Seokyoung Hong
“I hope to be a pianist that can remind and somehow transfer the audience’s own personal stories. From those reminded experiences, I hope they find happiness, relief, and even nostalgia. Beyond thinking about the stories from the past, I also hope they can imagine lots of things while and after listening to my performance.”

Seokyoung Hong has had several first or second-place finishes at international competitions in Korea, Switzerland, and the United States. Following two years at the Yewon School in his native Seoul, he moved to Boston in 2022 to study piano at the New England Conservatory Preparatory School with HaeSun Paik while also attending the Walnut Hill School for the Arts. He’s found himself inspired by his new environment: “Nature inspires me in various ways—its huge size, marvelous detail, the beauty of nature itself, and a lot more. For instance, the enormous entities like the ocean and the universe motivate me but also make me feel that I am only a small human.” Seokyoung finds inspiration and motivation from the two most recent winners of the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, South Korea’s Yekwon Sunwoo and Yunchan Lim, which was part of his motivation for taking part in the Cliburn Junior. He also hopes to develop his piano playing and artistry, as well as to build experience performing for large audiences. His interest in composing leads him to constantly study, he says, but he also enjoys riding his bike, playing chess, and participating in the table tennis club at school.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q7fVV_iNc0,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['3:31. Did he punch the keys? What term is it called?', 'Punching the keys 😂', ""Yeah man!!! Now we can hear Prokofiev's music in its full glory"", 'This pianist is already an up and coming world class virtuoso', '아따 잘친다', 'This guy is scary bruh. He’s incredible', 'Wonderful to see how someone so young views this piece as more than a virtuoso display; bringing out the melodic contours and rhythmic propulsion in such a masterful manner portends to a bright future for this very gifted youngster!\nBravo indeed! 👏', 'He plays it faster and without brain...', '정말 대단하네요', ""영화 '피아노의 전설'이 생각나게 하네요"", 'this is a good tempo for this pieces.

What an exciting talent', 'Splendid!!!👍👍👍 I got goose bumps!', 'Wow!!!❤', 'Buono...', 'Phenomenal', 'Probably the best interpretation', 'Listen to Argerich’s interpretation it is amazing', 'lol he has to beat Yuja and Argerich', ""Even though Argerich's interpretation is unique, it has a different soul than this one. S. Hong's playing is more to my liking."", 'Yakov zak, horowitz, and I forget if Prokofiev recorded this if he did him also Gilels!', ""He said he got inspired by Yunchang Lim's performance last year...."", 'Naw Charles Choccia puts all to shame. I thought Yuja was the best then I heard him and left jaw dropped.', '🔥🔥🔥 3:31 👊🏻', 'Hahaha yes', '멋있음 👍👍👍 프로코피에프 토카타 😊', 'Wow!❤']"

And if you have any more videos, I'd love to see them and hear more of his playing!\n\nI'm sorry for your loss"", ""We have Clara Schumann to thank for having to play without the music lol.\n\nI don't think it is necessarily a spot on the performers abilities that he uses a score.  I think what truly matters in the end is the execution, with or without a score.  \n\nI do find it odd that pianists probably have more to worry about note-wise then do any of the other instruments, yet we are one of the few who are expected to perform without music.  Strange"", ""I admit i cannot discuss the artistry or musicianship of flutists, saxophonists, or trumpeters intelligently, but I can discuss pianists.\nA piano piece to me is so much more impressive when the performer doesn't need the crutch of the music."", 'You\'ve said the same thing over and over on this thread in more than a half-dozen posts, ""drewbols."" Who cares what you believe is ""impressive"" — the word you keep repeating? Do you think that whining endlessly about what you regard as ""impressive"" and ""professional"" is discussing music ""intelligently""?\n\nWhy do you keep repeating yourself? Why should fret at interminable length about a pianist\'s having the printed music for six preludes on front of him? Especially when all YOU can manage to do is harp on the same single, tiresome note over and over again! \n\nI sense a sneer of ""these are sour grapes!"" coming from someone who\'s jealous of a first-rate performance. ""I own the score myself, and I\'ve studied it thoroughly,"" you write. And yet it\'s not YOUR performance that I\'m hearing and watching on this YouTube page. It is your carping that is unprofessional. Consider whether the people who run the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs just might be better, and far more experienced, judges than you in these matters.', ""Piano music--any music for that matter-- sounds so much better when every single tiny aspect of the music is done so intentionally, the performer knows exactly how much weight to apply to every single note, knows exactly how long to hold it down and knows indubitably the direction and phrasing of the entire piece. It is so much more impressive to see a performer who doesn't need to lean on the music."", ""if you have the ability to memorize notes, there's a problem if you can't remember dynamics. Expression should be memorized at the same time as the notes. I own the score myself, and I've studied it thoroughly. I don't see the logic of using music. If you've practiced correctly, you don't need it. Unless he is sight reading this... which would be amazing."", ""Articulation, dynamics. If you haven't seen this score, I suggest you look at it before you comment further."", ""I didn't quite follow that. Intention in every note is not limited to modern classical. I would say it is more so in baroque... i still don't understand why you think the sheet music was important. If you're not using it for the notes, why use it?"", ""But for music like this especially, where the composer's intention is specified in every note (as you would see often in 20th century music), I think it was important. You can tell he really wasn't using it for the notes by watching the video."", ""Yeah I know it's too bad some of the best pianists in the world do it. It looks so much more professional without music in my opinion."", ""Too bad some of the best pianists in the world do it. I saw a performance from Menachem Pressler...all with music.\n\nThis guy nails the Preludes...so as far as I'm concerned...it doesn't really matter that he had the music in front of him."", 'Either way, It is still more impressive, professional, and musical without the music in front of him', ""i know what you're saying, but if you watch his performance carefully he knows the music and his expression is there, dynamics, timing etc.  it's just that it's contemporary music, you always have the music in front of you.  but just because you have the score in front of you doesn't mean you can't put emotions into your playing."", ""i'm not saying he's a bad player, but it's much more impressive when he can concentrate on emotion instead of the music-- like how an actor can concentrate on emotion instead of the script."", ""yeah, a lot of musicians play with music in front of them, sometimes for memory, pianists usually play for memory, but in this case it's a contemporary piece, so it's okay...  sorry, but that's a poor analogy... you can't compare musicians and actors -- two totally different crafts."", ""A musician with music in front of him?? That's like an actor performing with a script! one star."", 'A ""grade 10"" piece...Yeah, I remember voting on that at the International Difficulty Classification of 20th Century Preludes for Piano Conference back in \'03.\n\nThere was a deadlock over exactly how many gold stars an ""excellent"" performance should earn (I voted six.)', ""I'm learning these preludes for next semester. Not terribly difficult note wise, but to get a concept of the musicality is pretty difficult. Michael, you do an excellent job at portraying the music. You play music, not the notes.\n\nYour performance is very inspiring!"", 'I am in the process of learning these preludes, and I was really impressed AND inspired with your performance of them!  Very musical and very fluid.  Your technique seems perfect!  Thanks for sharing!', ""i know how to play that piece!\r\nit's a grade 10 piece and it's not that hard. \r\nit's good for competition because nobody ever knows it!""]"

YUNCHAN LIM, 2022 Cliburn Gold Medalist
South Korea  I  Age 18

LISZT 12 Transcendental Etudes

Yunchan Lim launched onto the international music stage when he was 14. He won second prize and the Chopin Special Award in his first-ever competition, the Cleveland International Piano Competition for Young Artists in 2018. That same year, he stood out as the youngest participant in the Cooper International Competition, where he won the third prize and the audience prize, which provided the opportunity for him to perform with the Cleveland Orchestra. 2019 meant more accolades, when, at the age of 15, he was the youngest to win Korea’s IsangYun International Competition, where he also took home two special prizes.
 
Now just 18, he has performed across South Korea—including with the Korean Orchestra Festival, Korea Symphony, Suwon Philharmonic, and Busan Philharmonic Orchestras, among others—as well as in Madrid, at the invitation of the Korea Cultural Center in Spain. He also participated in the recording of “2020 Young Musicians of Korea,” organized by the Korean Broadcasting System and released that November. 
 
A native of Siheung, Yunchan currently studies at the Korea National University of Arts under Minsoo Sohn. Coming to Fort Worth, he says he is “looking forward to playing in front of the warmest and most passionate audience in the world.”",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzNYx7eWWN0,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['2:28 sound like Lisa widmug( deication)', '진짜 쫀득하다..', '좋다..', 'wow 숨을 쉴수가 없네요.웅장함에..\n진짜 노빠꾸❤', '심장이 쾅쾅 튀어오르는거  같아요❤❤❤❤', '감사합니다 thank you', '임윤찬♡forever', '❤❤❤', 'Yunchan Lim is so cool!

It\'s the reason I will keep pursuing music for the rest of my life.""\n\n(Before the final) ""I do not care whether I win or not, I\'ll just try my best to seek and deliver the heritage/legacy of the great musicians of the past to this age.""\n\nHe also said his purpose of playing the piano is to express the pain deep inside us and to heal people, again with music. ""Music (played by me) can\'t deceive people so I always try to have a genuinely compassionate and understanding heart toward human beings and the world.""\n\nHe often deliberately cuts himself from modern things or social media to fully communicate with the original composer and his intent, and be immersed in the music itself.  \n\nHe said there\'s a lava-like singing inside him but to perfectly express that music he needs to struggle for a long time, study and think a lot, and practice overnight, to go beyond the skills to the realm of pure art..\n\nHe also said that though he lives in this century, his mind is living in the 19th with the great minds of that time. He is inspired by lots of old literature as well as everyday incidents. For example, he read the Divine Comedy of Dante countless times and searched lots of foreign documentaries to play a piece of Liszt.', 'great mindset']"

ABOUT SIMON
What started with piano lessons at age 4 led Simon Finlow to study music at both Oxford (bachelor’s) and Cambridge (Ph.D.). He says “hard reality” led him to a career shift in the mid-80s. He emigrated from England to the United States, where he earned a master’s in computer science and information systems from American University and built a successful career in the field. In 2014, he quit his high-stress job and—having heard about the Cliburn Amateur while attending the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition the year prior—he rededicated himself to the piano. A former marathon runner, the physical and mental fortitude required for intensive training was not unfamiliar to him. Simon competed in the 2016 Cliburn Amateur and now performs regularly in the D.C. Metropolitan area. In his words: “I really feel as though I’ve been welcomed into an enormous, diverse, multi-national family of like-minded musicians.”",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qatfFYipRhQ,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['Stunning.

BACH  Prelude and Fugue in G-sharp Minor, BWV 863

About Seokyoung Hong
“I hope to be a pianist that can remind and somehow transfer the audience’s own personal stories. From those reminded experiences, I hope they find happiness, relief, and even nostalgia. Beyond thinking about the stories from the past, I also hope they can imagine lots of things while and after listening to my performance.”

Seokyoung Hong has had several first or second-place finishes at international competitions in Korea, Switzerland, and the United States. Following two years at the Yewon School in his native Seoul, he moved to Boston in 2022 to study piano at the New England Conservatory Preparatory School with HaeSun Paik while also attending the Walnut Hill School for the Arts. He’s found himself inspired by his new environment: “Nature inspires me in various ways—its huge size, marvelous detail, the beauty of nature itself, and a lot more. For instance, the enormous entities like the ocean and the universe motivate me but also make me feel that I am only a small human.” Seokyoung finds inspiration and motivation from the two most recent winners of the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, South Korea’s Yekwon Sunwoo and Yunchan Lim, which was part of his motivation for taking part in the Cliburn Junior. He also hopes to develop his piano playing and artistry, as well as to build experience performing for large audiences. His interest in composing leads him to constantly study, he says, but he also enjoys riding his bike, playing chess, and participating in the table tennis club at school.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3rzLdu5Hp8,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['멋진 바흐네요❤', '요즘 제가 느끼는 클래식에 대한 감정은, 전에는 바흐는 어떤 경지에 오른 사람들만이 인생을 반추하며 연주하는 거란 특정 틀을 만들어 회자시키곤 했던것 같은데, 지금 막 피어나기 시작하는 영피아니스트들은 이 모든 걸 스스로 극복하며 도전하고 그 경지라는 수준?을 매번 탈피를 거듭하면서 이루어내는 과정을 결코 두려워하지 않는 것 같아서 좋습니다.\n연주가 성숙되고 누구라도 인정하는 연주 실력이란 어찌보면 꽤나 주관적인 것 같기도 합니다.(물론 일정 수준의 프로 콘서트연주자들로 제한할 때)\n그래서인지 개인적으로는 컴페티션이란 제한적 룰이 적용되는 연주 상황에서도 어린 연주자들의 더 과감한 도전과 자기 방식의 레퍼토리 완성을 기대하게 됩니다.\n석영 피아니스트의 바흐도 좋네요.\n아직 성장 단계라고는 해도 건반 앞에서 바흐를 대하는 모습은 어려 보이지 않아요.\n그리고 전부터 느낀 거지만 석영 피아니스트의 손은 좀처럼 보기 힘든 크고 섬세한 손입니다.\n태생적 장점이 앞으로도 연주의 다양성과 완성도에 큰 장점으로 작용할 것을 의심치 않아요.😊\n세미파이널 때부터 우승할 것 같다 싶었는데 다시 한번 우승 축하드립니다~🎉', '~제 2의 임윤찬', 'Exelente ,! conoce a Bach. 🖐️🇮🇷', '👏👏👏', 'NoicE', '우승축하 하고 응원할께요!!']"

This guy is good but the technique needs work."", ""holy crap even Lang Lang couldn't manage dancing and facial contortions like those ones!"", ""@adXok Bozhanov makes me think about Glenn Gould. What he does is so unique, and so unexpected. That makes that people adore him... or hate him : there is no possibility between and that's not a good thing in competition.

I only hope that Bozhanov will have a great career so that he can gratify us with his art a long time because he is MORE than just a good pianist !"", '@Bennie347 because he is Bulgarian, thats the world we live in !', ""@KOEKIEkasper. Evgeni Bozhanov was the best but he only got the 2nd prize in the elisabeth-competition in Brussel... that's a pity because he is such a great artist.

So what if he missed a few notes? When it comes down to it, music is about emotion. He EASILY had the most to ""say"" in his playing-- he wasn\'t playing for the jury, he was playing for himself and us! I\'d definitely go see him play over any of the others.', '@sicko0011 Gounod/Liszt ""Faust"" waltz - says so right in the description.', ""@musicstars2005 It's a YouTube thing. Mostly, we can nothing but ignore it."", ""I have no formal training in classical music. So I don't know all the technicalities of what is good or what is bad. However, to me Evgeni Bozhanov seems to put life into that piano and the piano becomes an extension of him. Amazing talent."", '我想這就是所謂的演奏中有""自己的小宇宙""吧~非常投入!他表現了他的天才!非常棒！', 'What piece is this? Thanks', 'Okay, I\'m going to be Jingoistic here.  I prefer the Italians and Russians to the Chinese, who are technically superior but lack ""something"" I cannot define, like ""heart"" or ""feeling"" or something. But that\'s just my opinion.  ... I\'m hoping Cliburn will do another complete video like he did in 1985 that I still love to watch.', ""C'mon, this is supposed to be about  a circus, not a war. There's plenty of room in the world for lots of good pianists."", ""Is it just me or does the audio not seem to match the video at points? Excellent pianist!!! I watch this almost everyday. It's one of my favorite pieces of music and played splendidly!"", 'From 5:27 to 5:55 is my fauvorite part!!', ""Zhang was note perfect, while Bozhanov was not. But I prefer Bozhanov's originality."", 'Bravo!!!!!! Love him more than the others', 'Tell me exactly how the 19 year oild Zhang is fake . . .', 'Assolutamente una performance straordinaria!!! Diventerà sicuramente un grande musicista suona questo waltz come se fosse un opera teatrale!\nAl minuto 8:23 ..... sensazionale!', 'assolutamente un genio puro.', ""Uh yeah...the end wasn't exactly the most polished I've heard, but it was still great (and boy, that last chord was...wow?)!"", ""I think I like Di Wu's performance of this piece in the preliminaries better because it struck me as more sincere in terms of expression, but Mr. Bozhanov's rendition is really classy and has a really great waltz-like quality."", 'The audience overlooked his last chord which seemed way OFF.   LOL   They still stood and cheered.']"

To see all videos, visit cliburn.org/amateurspotlight

ABOUT EIJI
This Cliburn (now in 2022) appearance will mark the first time that Eiji Yoshimura will perform outside of Japan. A student of the piano from an early age, he’s been with his current teacher for 12 years, but has no formal music training. He graduated from the University of Tokyo with a Bachelor of Geophysics and initially worked as a system engineer. In 2009, he joined his current company, Avnet K.K, where he works in the distribution of semiconductors and electronic components, now as director of business planning. He spends his limited amount of non-work time at the piano. The 2011 winner of Tokyo’s amateur competition, Eiji comes to the Cliburn in hopes of sharing the “pleasure of music,” of “getting stimulation from excellent performances by other competitors,” and of confirming his love of piano music with new friends; he believe that “this is the best place for company with the same mind to come together.”",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-Rp2v_jO5o,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,

About Seokyoung Hong
“I hope to be a pianist that can remind and somehow transfer the audience’s own personal stories. From those reminded experiences, I hope they find happiness, relief, and even nostalgia. Beyond thinking about the stories from the past, I also hope they can imagine lots of things while and after listening to my performance.”

Seokyoung Hong has had several first or second-place finishes at international competitions in Korea, Switzerland, and the United States. Following two years at the Yewon School in his native Seoul, he moved to Boston in 2022 to study piano at the New England Conservatory Preparatory School with HaeSun Paik while also attending the Walnut Hill School for the Arts. He’s found himself inspired by his new environment: “Nature inspires me in various ways—its huge size, marvelous detail, the beauty of nature itself, and a lot more. For instance, the enormous entities like the ocean and the universe motivate me but also make me feel that I am only a small human.” Seokyoung finds inspiration and motivation from the two most recent winners of the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, South Korea’s Yekwon Sunwoo and Yunchan Lim, which was part of his motivation for taking part in the Cliburn Junior. He also hopes to develop his piano playing and artistry, as well as to build experience performing for large audiences. His interest in composing leads him to constantly study, he says, but he also enjoys riding his bike, playing chess, and participating in the table tennis club at school.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF7C3olij8w,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['sodelicious...........................', '석영님, 연습하신 그대로의 실력발휘 하시기를요!', '우승한게 언젠데 무슨 실력발휘임', '\xa0@user-cy5so4ji9h\xa0 ㅎㅎ 그렇군요. 본 채널 구독 중인데, 영상이 조금 전에 올라왔길래 콩쿨 진행 중인 줄 알았네요. 기사 찾아보니 벌써 보름 전이구만요!', '멋집니다!']"

Jing Xun Kuan - Malaysia

F. Chopin – Waltz in A minor, Op. 34 No. 2 00:00
J. Haydn – Sonata in C major, Hob.XVI:1 pt. I 05:10
J. S. Bach – Praeambulum from Partita in G major BWV 829 06:37

The idea of Szafarnia Piano Competition was born in 1992, when the first nationwide competition was held. The subsequent editions already have had an international profile. Since that time, each year the competition becomes the first step to a musical career for many young pianists.

From year to year, volunteers and participants coming from almost every corner of the world gather in Szafarnia.
Musical efforts are assessed by the Jury including distinguished pianists and music professors from international music academies. The participants are young pianists between the age of 6 and 16. Their program is presented in three age categories (first – up to 10 years of age, the second – up to 13, the third – up to 16). The competition is open to all pianists who are not the students of state-owned music schools.

The idea behind the International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition for Children and Youth is a common experience of music for the young pianists from around the world, an exchange of experience and a chance for a better understanding over cultural differences possible with the universal language of music.

The idea of Szafarnia Piano Competition was born in 1992, when the first nationwide competition was held. The subsequent editions already have had an international profile. Since that time, each year the competition becomes the first step to a musical career for many young pianists.

From year to year, volunteers and participants coming from almost every corner of the world gather in Szafarnia.
Musical efforts are assessed by the Jury including distinguished pianists and music professors from international music academies. The participants are young pianists between the age of 6 and 16. Their program is presented in three age categories (first – up to 10 years of age, the second – up to 13, the third – up to 16). The competition is open to all pianists who are not the students of state-owned music schools.

The idea behind the International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition for Children and Youth is a common experience of music for the young pianists from around the world, an exchange of experience and a chance for a better understanding over cultural differences possible with the universal language of music.

YUNCHAN LIM, 2022 Cliburn Gold Medalist
South Korea  I  Age 18

LISZT 12 Transcendental Etudes

Yunchan Lim launched onto the international music stage when he was 14. He won second prize and the Chopin Special Award in his first-ever competition, the Cleveland International Piano Competition for Young Artists in 2018. That same year, he stood out as the youngest participant in the Cooper International Competition, where he won the third prize and the audience prize, which provided the opportunity for him to perform with the Cleveland Orchestra. 2019 meant more accolades, when, at the age of 15, he was the youngest to win Korea’s IsangYun International Competition, where he also took home two special prizes.
 
Now just 18, he has performed across South Korea—including with the Korean Orchestra Festival, Korea Symphony, Suwon Philharmonic, and Busan Philharmonic Orchestras, among others—as well as in Madrid, at the invitation of the Korea Cultural Center in Spain. He also participated in the recording of “2020 Young Musicians of Korea,” organized by the Korean Broadcasting System and released that November. 
 
A native of Siheung, Yunchan currently studies at the Korea National University of Arts under Minsoo Sohn. Coming to Fort Worth, he says he is “looking forward to playing in front of the warmest and most passionate audience in the world.”",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ifk5Swd8WHk,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['Jesus Christ 😮😮', ""He's him."", ""I couldn't even edge to this"", 'ON A PIANO VIDEO IS CRAZY', 'Bro!?', 'he was 18 for this.........', 'Не спешите удивляться, завтра появиться какой нибудь китайский пианист которому 12 лет, и сыграет это в 3 раза быстрее)))', 'no one really play these particular twelve etudes in one setting at age of 12', 'Мне 13 и я разучиваю)', 'Могу начало сыграть и чать с 2:05', '\u200b\xa0@v6cut356\xa0 yeah but I dare you play all twelve in one setting', 'Как и Рихтер он наверное опаздывал на поезд))))', 'The technique is phenomenal. Superfluid playing and listen to the accents! Best recording of this masterpiece to date.', 'Did you listen to every recording of this piece?', ""\xa0@thenotsookayguy\xa0 No, but I've heard quite a few, and most of them play it too syncopated in my opinion."", ""\xa0@Trimza42\xa0 Sorry if you had any plans on the weekend, but I reckon you gotta sack them so that you can listen to the hundreds/thousands of recordings of this work on YT to determine the best one. Thx mate, I'm counting on you."", 'Every note was pristine, with clarity in abundance.  The melodies were always pronounced perfectly.  The speed only enhanced the beauty.  This is wonderful!  It is as good as Trifonov.  That was very hard for me to write!', ""I regret that my first exposure to this performance came months after it had occurred.  What I would have given to be casually watching this, only to have my hair set on fire there in the moment..........\n\nI'm surprised we don't hear spontaneous incredulous laughter from the audience.  This performance is nearly inhuman."", 'But the player is not meant to use this as a vehicle for showing off, rather, like Richter or Bolet, technique is meant to be in the service of the mood, here the fairie magic, delicate and shaded and subtle, each flame unique.', 'What an incredible performance. It rivals a live performance I heard when Vadim Kholodenko played it as an encore with an orchestra I played with shortly after his victory in Cliburn.', 'OH. MY.

Never have I seen any pianist tackling those pieces live."", '임윤찬이 치는 도깨비불은 굉장히 장난꾸러기같음', ""First, let me remind you that this is a competition, and as we all know, it's not easy to perform at 100% of your ability in a competitive setting. Pressure, nerves, anxiety, and other factors can come into play. Nevertheless, in the semifinals, he gave an incredible performance, playing all 12 transcendental etudes in one go, which is unprecedented! His technique of playing complex notes, intentionally designed to be difficult, with precise timing was truly impressive.\nHe demonstrated it brilliantly, bravo! While these skills are impressive in and of themselves, it is his unique interpretation and creativity (wit) that sets him apart.

What a great performance!"", '임윤찬 외계인설  🎶', 'A Good Performance but Not Quite In The League Of Kristina Miller...She is #1  For The Most Astounding Performance Ever Of Feux Follets .....her electrifying Performance is even better than Kissin or Ashkenazy ....( Her Performance is On YouTube ).....I Wish Horowitz had Recorded This ETUDE ( in 1977 he told me that he often played it in Russia before he came to The United States ) .....it would have sent us ALL back to The Practice Room 📣📣📣📣', ""There's something wrong with the camera. I can't see the nervousness in his face. I can't even see a drop of sweat throughout the entire recording despite him wiping some off."", '진짜 미친건가?', 'Bravo!', 'Pretty nice interpretation, nice and clean without overusing the sustain pedal or playing boring legato the whole time!', '매 연주 보는 것만으로도 황홀해서 초기절 하겠\U0001fae0', 'Trifonov, Cziffra and Richter are/were miles better - Liszt even marks Feux Follets leggiero and leggierissimo repeatedly, yet so few of the new generation seem to take any notice', 'Kissin\'s also.

But of course that's unfair, since the hardest piano piece in existence in 1829 was Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata.  \n\nThe Hammerklavier is very, very hard.  This etude is considerably harder."", 'No, hammelrklavier is a lot harder than this\u200b\xa0@herrbrahms\xa0', '2:16 the left jumps make me feel like a witch is laughing!!!', 'awesome!', '임윤찬♡forever', 'I want to listen to Yuja’s version', 'She can aspire to be the second best 😊', ""I don't think she could play the whole 12 Liszt Trans since they're not in her repertoire yet"", 'Kissin is definitely better, Yunchan  sounds too mechanically,  but still pretty good version', 'Seriously?', ""Maybe you have a recording I have not heard, but if you are going from the YouTube video of him in South America (an old video) I am sorry in NO respect can Kissin's  performance compare to Yunchan Lim. Yunchan's dynamics, velocity increase with repeated Themes and musicality which grasps the intention and Arc of this piece remains unrivalled."", ""I can't believe you saying this sounds mechanical.

ABOUT VIVIENNE
Growing up in an artistic and musical household, piano lessons were a must for Vivienne Fleischer. She began piano studies at the Mannes and Juilliard Prep Divisions, eventually earning her Artist Diploma from Juilliard and her Bachelor of Music at Oberlin Conservatory. During this time, she continued to play through pain and fatigue caused by repetitive stress injuries until it became impossible. Her process of retraining sparked a deep passion for helping others with workplace injuries. In 2001, she launched her own business: as co-founder and president of Performance Based Ergonomics, she works with companies to promote wellness, and injury prevention and recovery. After a 12-year hiatus from piano, she resumed lessons in New York City and began entering international amateur competitions; she is proud to be a two-time semifinalist at the International Competition of Outstanding Amateurs in Paris and finalist and honorable mention at Washington International Piano Artists Competition.  An additional benefit, she states: “it has been thrilling to have discovered a whole community of pianists who are astoundingly good and share a common passion.”",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bju3xSeUFmQ,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['That Rach is first rate!

J. S. Bach – Little Prelude in D minor 00:00
L. Schytte – Etude in F major, Op. 68 No. 11 01:30
F. Chopin – Waltz in A-flat major 03:10

The idea of Szafarnia Piano Competition was born in 1992, when the first nationwide competition was held. The subsequent editions already have had an international profile. Since that time, each year the competition becomes the first step to a musical career for many young pianists.

From year to year, volunteers and participants coming from almost every corner of the world gather in Szafarnia.
Musical efforts are assessed by the Jury including distinguished pianists and music professors from international music academies. The participants are young pianists between the age of 6 and 16. Their program is presented in three age categories (first – up to 10 years of age, the second – up to 13, the third – up to 16). The competition is open to all pianists who are not the students of state-owned music schools.

The idea behind the International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition for Children and Youth is a common experience of music for the young pianists from around the world, an exchange of experience and a chance for a better understanding over cultural differences possible with the universal language of music.

Don't rely so much on 'feelings'.    \n\n\nI wouldn't advocate a wait-and-see policy as far as you are concerned, for it as it says, it is appointed for men to die once, and then the judgment."", ""+\xa0Maafa 1619\xa0 \n'Science' itself has produced quite a litany of 'fairytales'.   Phlogiston:  there's a good one.   And I heard it maintained on a public information show, from an evolutionary perspective, that manatees had come from the sea, lived on the land, and returned to the sea once more.   No proof was given.   None needed, apparently.  They didn't even bother trotting out figures, in millions of years (pick a number!), regarding when these things 'happened'.    Anything offered up in the name of your god 'evolution' is considered sacred truth nowadays.   In fact sentiments of awe akin to 'religious' devotion are considered culturally appropriate in response to the Grand Master Plan Originating From Nobody For No Reason.   I tell you, 'EVOLUTION' IS A RELIGION.   That's why you people are so hostile to Christianity, like the muslims etc.  \n\n\nAs for the presence of marine fossils at high altitudes, does that support uniformitarian theory or catastrophism?  How do you account for vast 'fossil graveyards' apart from catastrophism, considering that under normal circumstances dead animal material decomposes and disperses rather quickly?   \nBut you guys are used to swallowing intellectual pablum.   How could you POSSIBLY be expected to read complex literature like the Bible, and undestand it?   IMPOSSIBLE.   You probably do not even understand the difference between literal and figurative speech.   \n\n\n'Scientists' invent THEORIES about how the universe arrived at its present state.   If they are honest, they will admit that these are just theories.   REALLY USEFUL science seeks in poractical ways to make human life less miserable, based on what has been learend about the created universe.   \n\n\nBut Christianity PROPER is not theory or speculation.   Living human beings WITNESSED the ministry, death, and Resurrection of Jesus Christ, and we are fortunate to have the historical record.  But you value your own prejudices more highly than truth, therefore you will not consider the evidence.   The truth about Jesus would shake up your little mental world."", 'I don‘t know about Jesus a lot but i‘m sure she is working really hard. That is result she succeed today. Such a talented girl.', 'Heerlijk!', 'Knap hoor!', 'Geweldig wat dit meisje kan.', 'Ongelooflijk!  Hoe die kleine vingertjes zo vlotjes over de toetsen glijden!', 'Bravo!', 'BEAUTIFUL!!

Quarterfinal Round Recital
Saturday, June 10, 2023
Caruth Auditorium at SMU  I  Dallas, Texas USA

CHOPIN Ballade No. 2 in F Major, op. 38

About Seokyoung Hong
“I hope to be a pianist that can remind and somehow transfer the audience’s own personal stories. From those reminded experiences, I hope they find happiness, relief, and even nostalgia. Beyond thinking about the stories from the past, I also hope they can imagine lots of things while and after listening to my performance.”

Seokyoung Hong has had several first or second-place finishes at international competitions in Korea, Switzerland, and the United States. Following two years at the Yewon School in his native Seoul, he moved to Boston in 2022 to study piano at the New England Conservatory Preparatory School with HaeSun Paik while also attending the Walnut Hill School for the Arts. He’s found himself inspired by his new environment: “Nature inspires me in various ways—its huge size, marvelous detail, the beauty of nature itself, and a lot more. For instance, the enormous entities like the ocean and the universe motivate me but also make me feel that I am only a small human.” Seokyoung finds inspiration and motivation from the two most recent winners of the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, South Korea’s Yekwon Sunwoo and Yunchan Lim, which was part of his motivation for taking part in the Cliburn Junior. He also hopes to develop his piano playing and artistry, as well as to build experience performing for large audiences. His interest in composing leads him to constantly study, he says, but he also enjoys riding his bike, playing chess, and participating in the table tennis club at school.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mWD7Ikr-1w,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,"['beautiful', '이 풍부하고 온화하면서 우렁찬 소리를 열다섯살의 소년이 내는 소리라니요. \n수상을 축하합니다. 내일처럼 기쁜 소식입니다.', ""Yet another brilliant pianist... hes got all the elements there in his hand!

With his wife, Georgian-American pianist Ana Glig, he has recently made select duo piano and chamber appearances in Massachusetts, and in May 2019, the couple sponsored their first competition for young classical pianists in Gurjaani, Georgia.

The idea of Szafarnia Piano Competition was born in 1992, when the first nationwide competition was held. The subsequent editions already have had an international profile. Since that time, each year the competition becomes the first step to a musical career for many young pianists.

From year to year, volunteers and participants coming from almost every corner of the world gather in Szafarnia.
Musical efforts are assessed by the Jury including distinguished pianists and music professors from international music academies. The participants are young pianists between the age of 6 and 16. Their program is presented in three age categories (first – up to 10 years of age, the second – up to 13, the third – up to 16). The competition is open to all pianists who are not the students of state-owned music schools.

The idea behind the International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition for Children and Youth is a common experience of music for the young pianists from around the world, an exchange of experience and a chance for a better understanding over cultural differences possible with the universal language of music.

The idea of Szafarnia Piano Competition was born in 1992, when the first nationwide competition was held. The subsequent editions already have had an international profile. Since that time, each year the competition becomes the first step to a musical career for many young pianists.

From year to year, volunteers and participants coming from almost every corner of the world gather in Szafarnia.
Musical efforts are assessed by the Jury including distinguished pianists and music professors from international music academies. The participants are young pianists between the age of 6 and 16. Their program is presented in three age categories (first – up to 10 years of age, the second – up to 13, the third – up to 16). The competition is open to all pianists who are not the students of state-owned music schools.

The idea behind the International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition for Children and Youth is a common experience of music for the young pianists from around the world, an exchange of experience and a chance for a better understanding over cultural differences possible with the universal language of music.

Ma capisco che tutti abbiamo i nostri gusti e prediligiamo alcune interpretazioni rispetto ad altre.

Le interpretazioni bachiane del passato al clavicembalo erano estremamente più ""libere"", ""enfatizzate"", noi oggi diremmo ""romantiche"", proprio perchè lo strumento offriva possibilità espressive diverse: anticipazioni del basso o della melodia, ritardandi lunghi, oscillazioni temporali. Non è lo strumento che rende ""romantico"" o meno un brano...per me Bach è romantico, Chopin assolutamente no.', 'No, credo che fosse Bach che suonava Chopin', 'Bach Capriccio in Bb major.

But technically those 2 pieces are relatively easier compared to many concert level pieces.  I enjoy his facial expressiveness.  He really enjoyed playing.', '3 pieces. After Bach, Debussy Estampes and Stravinsky Petrushka, which are not ""easier""...', ""Too bad the ending iscut off. You don't get to hear this piece-a favorite of mine-very often, in fact few people even seem to know of it. A rare example of program music in Bach. I know it well because years ago I went to many Roslyn Tureck recitals, and she often included it-really going to town with the fugue. (There is a recrording of her doing it) In fact for yrs. she was the only person who played it.

Cioè si smarriva: era alla tastiera e altrove. Mai e poi mai ci si è ""messo dentro"", che sarebbe stato fare un torto a Bach perché lo stesso compositore, per primo, non è mai ""stato in sé"". Bach vuole portarci in alto, è un miracolo. Ma la forza di gravità lavora meglio di lui...', 'Chi crede che Bach possa essere ""interpretato liberamente"" non capisce nulla di Bach;non per un pregiudizio, ma per un fatto essenziale: Bach è struttura, ed è proprio da questa costruzione sovraindividuale che scatta l\'emozione: patetizzare Bach significa perdersi nel particolare a discapito dell\'universale: infilare dentro Bach il PROPRIO sentire personale significa psicologizzarlo, ed è direi infima cosa, perché Bach è spirituale per eccellenza.

Enjoy his performance of Sofia Gubaidulina's Chaconne. And rewatch all Cliburn Amateur Spotlights at cliburn.org/amateurspotlight

ABOUT FERDY
Music changed Ferdy Talan’s life when he was growing up in Jakarta; it led him to New York, where he’s “embarked on a decade-long journey of self-discovery, breaking through societal and self-imposed boundaries and limitations.” While working fulltime as an agent for Alf Naman Real Estate Advisors, he’s developing his artistic craft, taking regular lessons and competing in amateur piano competitions: in 2017, he won in St. Petersburg and Boston, and placed second in Washington, D.C. As to why he’s entered the 2020 Cliburn: “Although the profiles of most careers are made by performances in well-known venues, based on my early music influence, I would like to be the catalyst for other young people and help the new generation with an ability to go far beyond the usual expectations.” His interests outside of real estate and the piano include international cuisine, architecture, and interior design.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj482i-DwM8,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Oz2fuXlILwEH4P96h2LLg,['👌👌💯🔝🙌']

F. Chopin – Fantaisie-Impromptu in C sharp minor, Op. 66 01:55
N. Rimsky-Korsakov – Flight of the Bumblebee 07:48

The idea of Szafarnia Piano Competition was born in 1992, when the first nationwide competition was held. The subsequent editions already have had an international profile. Since that time, each year the competition becomes the first step to a musical career for many young pianists.

From year to year, volunteers and participants coming from almost every corner of the world gather in Szafarnia.
Musical efforts are assessed by the Jury including distinguished pianists and music professors from international music academies. The participants are young pianists between the age of 6 and 16. Their program is presented in three age categories (first – up to 10 years of age, the second – up to 13, the third – up to 16). The competition is open to all pianists who are not the students of state-owned music schools.

The idea behind the International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition for Children and Youth is a common experience of music for the young pianists from around the world, an exchange of experience and a chance for a better understanding over cultural differences possible with the universal language of music.

Remember: watch all videos cliburn.org/amateurspotlight

ABOUT XIAO
Xiao Chen grew up in Shenzhen, China, which he notes is known as the country’s “Piano City-to-be,” which nurtured renowned pianists Sa Chen, Yundi Li, and Haochen Zhang. Unlike the many children whose parents forced them to pursue the piano (as a means to cultivate their suzhi, or quality), Xiao begged his parents for lessons at the age of 12. He continued to study piano, aesthetics, and ethnomusicology during most of his extensive academic pursuits: a bachelor’s in philosophy from Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou); an M.A. in Asian studies from the University of Michigan, with a thesis entitled, ""The 'Pianistic Other' in Shenzhen (1978–2007)""; and a Ph.D. in organizational behavior and human resource management from the University of Toronto. After a stint as an assistant professor at Tsinghua University's School of Economics and Management in Beijing, he now teaches at the University of Prince Edward Island in Charlottetown, Canada, and has very recently resumed formal piano lessons.
