H0-BU62EEfE,0,Contrasts - ABRSM Grade 7 specimen No. 13 - Sight-reading progress July 2023 #30piecechallenge,20231228,70,90,6,,2,"I've been hesitating to make it ""public"" but I've been trying to make the #30piecechallenge this year.
The 40/30/20 piece challenge has been quite popular among musicians in the past few years, I came across this challenge on the website ""Piano Syllabus"", and I'm tracking my pieces there.

The main idea is that most students only learn around 10 pieces each year, but practising more pieces is what actually fuels motivation and improves sight-reading significantly. I like this logic, so I decided to give it a try!

You can read more about this challenge here:
https://elissamilne.com/2015/02/04/where-did-the-40-piece-challenge-begin/

I think 40 pieces would be too many for me, so I went for the middle number: 30 pieces in a year, starting January 2023.

I've always practised a lot of sightreading, and it seems unfair to me to exclude this big part of my practice from the challenge. Since the start of the year, I have sight-read 8 books of sightreading pieces already and I usually read them twice, underline pieces that I find harder and read those again a third time. Seems fair to me to record 1 or 2 pieces/exercises from each of the books I go through and count them as ""1"" for this challenge. 
So here it goes, these are two of the hardest pieces from the book: 

Piano Specimen Sight-reading tests (From 2009) Grade 7
This exercise is from page 14 No. 8 ""Contrasts"".
I finished sight-reading this book on the 13th of July 2023.
I've currently completed 60% of the 30 pieces and I should be at 66%. I'm a bit behind!

I'll post other excerpts in the following weeks, every Thursday at 2:30pm UK time.

Like and subscribe to see if I'll make it to 30 pieces by December!

This exercise is all about bringing out the contrast between piano and forte. It's easy to ignore dynamics when reading, so this is a good one!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0-BU62EEfE,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSoasSmoWrTAmeDUP65hl3A,"['Very beautifully played 👏🏻', 'Thank you 😊']"

The 40/30/20 piece challenge has been quite popular among musicians in the past few years, I came across this challenge on the website ""Piano Syllabus"", and I'm tracking my pieces there.

The main idea is that most students only learn around 10 pieces each year, but practising more pieces is what actually fuels motivation and improves sight-reading significantly. I like this logic, so I decided to give it a try!

You can read more about this challenge here:
https://elissamilne.com/2015/02/04/where-did-the-40-piece-challenge-begin/

I think 40 pieces would be too many for me, so I went for the middle number: 30 pieces in a year, starting January 2023.

I've always practised a lot of sightreading, and it seems unfair to me to exclude this big part of my practice from the challenge. Since the start of the year, I have sight-read 8 books of sightreading pieces already and I usually read them twice, underline pieces that I find harder and read those again a third time. Seems fair to me to record 1 or 2 pieces/exercises from each of the books I go through and count them as ""1"" for this challenge. 
So here it goes, these are two of the hardest pieces from the book: 

Joining the dots Grade 5 A. Bullard
The exercises are from page 42 ""Sheepdog"" and page 44 ""Mirror on the wall"".
I finished sight-reading this on the 23rd of February 2023.
I've currently completed 60% of the 30 pieces and I should be at 66%. I'm a bit behind!

I'll post other excerpts in the following weeks, every Thursday at 2:30pm UK time.

jje--8VqhMY,0,Improve your sightreading 6 - P. Harris Sight-reading progress Mar 2023 #30piecechallenge,20231214,91,125,6,,2,"I've been hesitating to make it ""public"" but I've been trying to make the #30piecechallenge this year.
The 40/30/20 piece challenge has been quite popular among musicians in the past few years, I came across this challenge on the website ""Piano Syllabus"", and I'm tracking my pieces there.

The main idea is that most students only learn around 10 pieces each year, but practising more pieces is what actually fuels motivation and improves sight-reading significantly. I like this logic, so I decided to give it a try!

You can read more about this challenge here:
https://elissamilne.com/2015/02/04/where-did-the-40-piece-challenge-begin/

I think 40 pieces would be too many for me, so I went for the middle number: 30 pieces in a year, starting January 2023.

I've always practised a lot of sightreading, and it seems unfair to me to exclude this big part of my practice from the challenge. Since the start of the year, I have sight-read 8 books of sightreading pieces already and I usually read them twice, underline pieces that I find harder and read those again a third time. Seems fair to me to record 1 or 2 pieces/exercises from each of the books I go through and count them as ""1"" for this challenge. 
So here it goes, these are two of the hardest pieces from the book: 

Improve sightreading 6 - P. Harris
The exercises are from page 35 ""Yoghurts and berries"" and pag. 36 ""Snakes and ladders"".
Had to record them twice because the first time I recorded them vertically xD
I finished sight-reading this book in March 2023.
I've currently completed 63% of the 30 pieces and I should be at 68%. I'm a bit behind!

I'll post other excerpts in the following weeks, every Thursday at 2:30pm UK time.

It's been 2y now since I started playing the piano so it's definitely possible to learn hard pieces if you're a beginner/intermediate. Hope this inspires some of you to learn your favourite classical pieces ;)

I'm really inspired by your video especially your self-improvement one, may I ask during this period or even the earlier piano pieces you practiced were you practicing with sheet music or through videos?

If you just play for fun and you don't really care if you can read or not - you just want to be able to play the piece - then I think learning through videos works. Nowadays I do a mix of synthesia / sheet music / playing by ear, depending on the piece. Hope it helps 👍🏼"", 'Hey nice work mate !

For example, this piece I learned in a method where you just bring sheet music and go through the piece while trying to play parts very good in the first time when you see them, but this is a long journey process and you will play the first parts better than the middle and the end. It is can be seen even in this video. The piano teacher, which helped me for free said that her students are trying to learn pieces by going left hand 2 times from sheet music and 1 time from memory for 2-4 measures, then the same for the right hand and together. Then in the next day shouldn't repeat this part and go to the next. I might add another feedback to this method when I'll be close to finishing memorizing any piece."", '\xa0@pianopracticediary\xa0 Update: this method is good for remembering sheets, but not for mastering a piece. But the pattern about not repeating the same parts every day works fine here as well.']"

gY3GMUymUlQ,0,Stumblings - Bartók - Sight-reading progress October 2023 #30piecechallenge,20240111,155,50,3,,5,"I've been hesitating to make it ""public"" but I've been trying to make the #30piecechallenge in 2023.
The 40/30/20 piece challenge has been quite popular among musicians in the past few years, I came across this challenge on the website ""Piano Syllabus"", and I'm tracking my pieces there.

The main idea is that most students only learn around 10 pieces each year, but practising more pieces is what actually fuels motivation and improves sight-reading significantly. I like this logic, so I decided to give it a try!

You can read more about this challenge here:
https://elissamilne.com/2015/02/04/where-did-the-40-piece-challenge-begin/

I think 40 pieces would be too many for me, so I went for the middle number: 30 pieces in a year, starting January 2023.

I've always practised a lot of sightreading, and it seems unfair to me to exclude this big part of my practice from the challenge. Since the start of the year, I have sight-read 8 books of sightreading pieces already and I usually read them twice, underline pieces that I find harder and read those again a third time. Seems fair to me to record 1 or 2 pieces/exercises from each of the books I go through and count them as ""1"" for this challenge. 
So here it goes, this is one of the hardest pieces from the book: 

Mikrokosmos vol. 3 by Bartók. Mikrokosmos is super hard to sight-read, and that's the whole point. Most pieces have no clear melody, it's completely unpredictable. This makes it hard to read, great practice, but quite a torture to listen to and practice. I have finished sight-reading the first 2 volumes in the past months and now I've finished volume 3. There are a total of 6, in increasing difficulty. 
This exercise is from vol. 3 page 107 No. 96: ""Stumblings"".
I finished sight-reading this book on the 27th of October 2023.

I started posting these videos a while ago, then realized that they were bringing my views down significantly. Who wants to listen to slow sight-reading? I don't blame anyone lol 
But then I started not caring and I'm posting them anyway ahah

In this piece there are long notes that I purposely didn't hold for as much as I should have, to avoid having ""silence"" for too long, because I'm reading very slow eheh. There are some hesitations but that's normal lol.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY3GMUymUlQ,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSoasSmoWrTAmeDUP65hl3A,"['Very good sight reading practice 👏🏻', '😀❤️', 'one for the algo😅', '🤣👏Thank you ❤️', 'Here is why the Mikrokosmos collection is infamous 💀']"

Hello! I've prepared the first piece from WTC Book 1. It took me 15 hours to learn and I've tried to learn while sight-reading and spent around 4 hours, but this was a bad idea, haha.
In general, I'm not fully happy about this performance, but I started this piece in early January, so it's been 1,5 months and I should move on to the hardest ones.
I have a big plan for both WTC Books, so this piece will be replayed when I will have more experience.

2 years and a half piano progress

It's incredible how much practice goes into a piece of music. It took me 25 HOURS of extenuating practice to learn less than a minute of music! 
Fun fact (not so fun): This is my third time trying this etude. I tried it and gave up twice during the past year! For some reason I kept missing notes and getting frustrated, maybe I just wasn't used to the distance between thirds, and it took my hands an endless amount of slow practice to get that.
The result is sooooo satisfying though! 
The first recording is while using metronome at 130 bpm,
the second one is trying to go even faster, without metronome, which doesn't work very well lol 
Did you notice my foot tapping the rhythm? xD

6SbMVv3hr4g,,Sightreading progress (Jan 2023) - Improve your sight reading 5 (P. Harris) #30piecechallenge,20230831,84,137,6,,7,"I've been hesitating to make it ""public"" but I've been trying to make the  #30piecechallenge this year.
The 40/30/20 piece challenge has been quite popular among musicians in the past few years, I came across this challenge on the website ""Piano Syllabus"", and I'm tracking my pieces there.

The main idea is that most students only learn around 10 pieces each year, but practising more pieces is what actually fuels motivation and improves sight-reading significantly. I like this logic, so I decided to give it a try!

You can read more about this challenge here:
https://elissamilne.com/2015/02/04/where-did-the-40-piece-challenge-begin/

I think 40 pieces would be too many for me, so I went for the middle number: 30 pieces in a year, starting January 2023.

I've always practised a lot of sightreading, and it seems unfair to me to exclude this big part of my practice from the challenge. Since the start of the year, I have sight-read 8 books of sightreading pieces already and I usually read them twice, underline pieces that I find harder and read those again a third time. Seems fair to me to record 1 or 2 pieces/exercises from each of the books I go through and count them as ""1"" for this challenge. 
So here it goes, these are two of the hardest pieces from the book: 
""Improve your sight reading 5 (P. Harris)
The exercises are from page 36 ""Sprightly"" and page 37 ""Minuetto"".
I finished sight-reading this in January 2023.
I've currently completed 53.3% of the 30 pieces. I'm a bit behind!

I'll post other excerpts in the following weeks.

Grade 7 sight-reading is no joke... this video is not proper sight-reading, I had to practice this quite a while to get it right, and I'm playing VERY slow!

Over the last 2 months, I've been practicing this piece through sheet music. The most complex and technically demanding classical piece I've played with sheet music so far. When I first saw the sheets I thought that it would take a very long time to play it with no mistakes and acceptable dynamics. 2 months later, here we are. Probably the best 2nd Movement of any of Beethoven's Sonatas.

Hope you enjoy it!

afvqJIep29M,,ABRSM Grade 6 specimen - June 2023 sight-reading #30piecechallenge,20231207,106,82,7,,5,"I've been hesitating to make it ""public"" but I've been trying to make the #30piecechallenge this year.
The 40/30/20 piece challenge has been quite popular among musicians in the past few years, I came across this challenge on the website ""Piano Syllabus"", and I'm tracking my pieces there.

The main idea is that most students only learn around 10 pieces each year, but practising more pieces is what actually fuels motivation and improves sight-reading significantly. I like this logic, so I decided to give it a try!

You can read more about this challenge here:
https://elissamilne.com/2015/02/04/where-did-the-40-piece-challenge-begin/

I think 40 pieces would be too many for me, so I went for the middle number: 30 pieces in a year, starting January 2023.

I've always practised a lot of sightreading, and it seems unfair to me to exclude this big part of my practice from the challenge. Since the start of the year, I have sight-read 8 books of sightreading pieces already and I usually read them twice, underline pieces that I find harder and read those again a third time. Seems fair to me to record 1 or 2 pieces/exercises from each of the books I go through and count them as ""1"" for this challenge. 
So here it goes, these are two of the hardest pieces from the book: 

Piano Specimen Sight-reading tests (From 2009) Grade 6
The exercises are from page 23 ""The old bridge"" and ""Happy song"".
I finished sight-reading this on the 8th of June 2023.
I've currently completed 60% of the 30 pieces and I should be at 66%. I'm a bit behind!

I'll post other excerpts in the following weeks, every Thursday at 2:30pm UK time.

Like and subscribe to see if I'll make it to 30 pieces by December!

I heard this piece for the 1st time when I watched Seong-Jin Cho play it live in London, back in February. It's too beautiful, I had to learn it. 

More technically demanding than usual because of the ornaments / trills, dynamics and contrary hand movements. 

I'm trying to increase the difficulty with each piece I learn. I like how it turned out. I hope you do too!

Молорик! Так держать! Когда твой сОльник в Карнеги-Холл ждать?)', 'Через час :)', '\xa0@mrsmokkkk\xa0 эх, поздно прочитал. Как раз пролетал мимо на частном самолёте, думал десантироваться с парашютом туда. Значит, в следующий раз как-нибудь.🙃', 'Nice Video!!\nI think thats the perfect format for practice videos. Very much fun to watch, not like those people who will just mindlessly upload their full practice sessions😅', 'Thanks 😅', 'Very nice! Keep it up!', 'Thanks, I will!', ""That's the spirite mate! Keep it up! (tho please for your sake lower it to 6, in the start u do need to practice more, but 6 hours is ENOUGH, 8 hours will at best exhaust you more than they will help you.) You are doing great for now, but plan on getting a teacher, if not I suggest continue the scales, do every clear then add sharps and flats, do sight reading too! The more you do it the better you get and the faster you can learn new pieces, as for later down the ride get started on Etudes, but not something crazy like Chopin's! Czerny's etudes are what gets a begginer to the next level, op.599 and op.139 are perfect to start from and build up foundation, as well as op.821, ESPECIALLY op.337. Once you've done most of the etudes and mentioned above, you can safely move to more of Bach's Preludes and Fuges, as well as op.299. I suggest taking the least pleasant ones that you can find and doing them, they feel more like a challange and who doesn't love to be the best at challanges (+ they all sound nice even if at the start like a mess)?\n\nAt that point you might aswell REALLY consider getting a teacher, but if you don't, thenn start doin czerny's op.636 then move to op.740 (yep, the one we all know, op.740) At this point if you kept doing the other stuff like sight reading and playing scales you will be at a fairly good level and play most piano pieces with fair ease, I'd say start playing infront of other people at that point, family mainly, but could be friends. Prepare a few good sounding pieces and show them off, if you get stuck somewhere btw, dont stop or redo, continue, NEVER stop and redo... (i may or may not have had to learn that the hard way) But once you've done that, well, you can greet Liszt and Chopin, I won't say anything specific here, but if you feel a pain while playing, stop and rest. Oh at that point playing 6h a day fully commited to practicing is pointless, something like 2 hours to practice (so cleaning up pieces) 1-1/5 hours of other practice (scales, sight reeding, etc.) and you can also spend time playing whatever you want, but don't forget the 3-3/5 hours of practice, they must be priority.\n\nOnce you've done quite a bit of Chopin and List just search for hard pieces on youtube and start doing those, at that point your level of ability would be as high as a pianist, tho it really depends on consistency, if you dont practice every day it might take years, if you do, it will at best take 2 years (but u must keep the practice at a high quality otherwise it wont really do that much) But I advice taking brakes, daily practice is fun and all but like it can be a bit much at times.\n\nOn a more general note, piano seems harder to learn than it is, kinda like gym, its hard starting up, but once you've done so you just gotta keep it on, and I mean why wouldn't you? \n\nAs a final note: Work on technique, cresh. de-cresh, fast changes in dynamics, learn to do them good. Learn how to controll your hand, so no fingers in the air while playing chords! Learn VERY WELL especially when you are starting out how to play legato, non-legato and staccato. And finally, learn how to properly sight-read, notes and dynamics are a very, VERY LITTLE PART of what is written on the sheet, learn to read everything, and learn to play it. Thats probably one of the hardest thing you'll face, but good things dont come easily, and trust me, good sightreading is one of the best things you can learn to do.\n\nGood luck mate! And don't forget, it looks harder than it is!"", 'Thanks for the tips, really appreciated.']"
